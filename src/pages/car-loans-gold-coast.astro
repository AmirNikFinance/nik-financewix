  heroDescription="Need car finance on the Gold Coast? NIK Finance compares car loan products from 130+ lenders to find the best rates for your new or used vehicle purchase on the Gold Coast."
  cityDescription="The Gold Coast's linear coastal layout, stretching from Coolangatta to Coomera, and limited rail coverage beyond the light rail corridor make car ownership a practical requirement for most residents. The region's tourism, hospitality, and construction industries employ a diverse workforce, from casual staff to high-earning contractors, each with different lending requirements. NIK Finance helps Gold Coast drivers find better car finance than what's available through the dealership clusters along Southport-Nerang Road and the Pacific Highway. Our AI technology is especially effective for borrowers with non-traditional income, such as seasonal hospitality workers, real estate agents on commission, and tradies running their own businesses. We also arrange finance for boats and jet skis, popular with Gold Coast residents embracing the coastal lifestyle."
