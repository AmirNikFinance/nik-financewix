        <h2 class="font-montserrat font-bold text-2xl md:text-3xl text-[#1e3a5f] mb-6">What Is a Novated Lease?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">A novated lease is a three-way agreement between you (the employee), your employer, and a finance company. Your employer agrees to make lease payments and vehicle running cost payments from your pre-tax salary on your behalf. This reduces your taxable income, which means you pay less income tax. The vehicle belongs to you — if you change employers, the lease transfers with you.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">Unlike a company car, you choose the vehicle. Unlike a standard car loan, repayments come from pre-tax income. The employer is simply a payment facilitator — there is no financial risk or cost to them, which is why most medium-to-large employers offer novated leasing as a benefit.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">A novated lease bundles the vehicle finance, registration, insurance, servicing, tyres, fuel, and roadside assist into a single regular payment from your salary. This simplifies budgeting and can reduce total vehicle costs significantly.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="mb-16">
        <h2 class="font-montserrat font-bold text-2xl md:text-3xl text-[#1e3a5f] mb-6">How the Tax Savings Work</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">The savings come from two sources: income tax reduction and GST savings.</p>
        <h3 class="font-montserrat font-semibold text-xl text-[#0d4d3e] mt-8 mb-4">Income Tax Savings</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">Lease payments deducted from your pre-tax salary reduce your taxable income. If you earn $100,000 and salary sacrifice $15,000 annually for your car, you are only taxed on $85,000. At the 32.5% marginal rate plus 2% Medicare levy, this saves approximately $5,175 per year in tax.</p>
        <h3 class="font-montserrat font-semibold text-xl text-[#0d4d3e] mt-8 mb-4">GST Savings</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">When a vehicle is purchased through a novated lease, the GST (10%) on the purchase price is not payable by you. On a $55,000 car, the GST saving is $5,000. Running costs paid through the lease are also GST-free.</p>
        <h3 class="font-montserrat font-semibold text-xl text-[#0d4d3e] mt-8 mb-4">FBT Exemption for EVs</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">For eligible battery electric vehicles, the FBT exemption means 100% of the lease and running costs come from pre-tax salary with no fringe benefits tax payable. This is the most powerful tax benefit available for vehicle finance in Australia. For petrol and diesel vehicles, a portion of the lease must be paid from after-tax salary (the Employee Contribution Method) to minimise FBT.</p>
        <div class="bg-[#0d4d3e]/5 border-l-4 border-[#10b981] rounded-r-lg p-6 my-6"><p class="text-[#0d4d3e] font-lato font-light leading-relaxed">Illustration: A $55,000 EV on a 5-year novated lease with a $100,000 salary could cost approximately $260–$320 per week from pre-tax income including all running costs. Buying the same car with a standard car loan would cost approximately $250–$300 per week from after-tax income PLUS fuel, insurance, registration, and servicing separately. The novated lease is typically $3,000–$8,000 cheaper per year on a total-cost basis.</p></div>

        <section class="mb-16">
        <h2 class="font-montserrat font-bold text-2xl md:text-3xl text-[#1e3a5f] mb-6">Who Can Get a Novated Lease?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">You need to be a salaried employee (full-time, part-time, or fixed-term contract) with an employer who offers salary packaging or novated leasing. Most employers with 50+ employees offer this, and many smaller employers will set it up on request since it costs them nothing.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">Self-employed individuals, sole traders, and contractors paid through their own company cannot access novated leasing because there is no employer-employee relationship to novate. For business vehicle finance, a chattel mortgage or hire purchase is the equivalent structure.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">You do not need perfect credit — while credit checks apply, the regular salary deduction provides certainty to the lender. If you have been in your role for 3+ months and can demonstrate stable income, you are likely eligible.</p>

        <h2 class="font-montserrat font-bold text-2xl md:text-3xl text-[#1e3a5f] mb-6">What Happens When You Change Jobs?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">The lease belongs to you, not your employer. When you change jobs, the novation simply transfers to your new employer. If your new employer does not offer novated leasing, you can take over the payments personally (they come from after-tax income until you find an employer who will novate). You do not lose the vehicle or need to pay out the lease early.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">This portability is one of the key advantages over a company car, where you typically return the vehicle when you leave.</p>
