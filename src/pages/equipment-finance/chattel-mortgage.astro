For example, on a $55,000 vehicle (GST-inclusive), the GST component is $5,000 — which you claim in full in your next BAS. On a $110,000 truck, the GST recovery is $10,000.

You cannot claim tax deductions on interest or depreciation. A chattel mortgage is a business finance product — you can claim GST upfront, deduct interest as a business expense, and claim depreciation on the asset. Chattel mortgages require an ABN and business use of the asset."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I set a balloon payment on a chattel mortgage?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes. Most chattel mortgages allow a balloon (residual value) of up to 30–40% of the purchase price. This reduces your monthly repayments during the term. At the end, you pay the balloon to take full ownership, refinance the remaining amount, or trade the vehicle/equipment in. Setting a balloon is a popular strategy for managing business cash flow."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What happens at the end of a chattel mortgage?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"If there is no balloon payment, you own the asset outright once the final repayment is made — the lender discharges their security interest on the PPSR. If you set a balloon, you have three options at the end of term: pay the balloon in cash to take full ownership, refinance the balloon amount into a new loan, or sell or trade the asset and use the proceeds to pay the balloon."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Is a chattel mortgage good for utes and work vehicles?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes — chattel mortgages are the most common way Australian tradespeople and businesses finance work utes, vans, and trucks. The combination of GST recovery, interest deductions, and depreciation makes it highly tax-effective. Popular work vehicles like the Ford Ranger, Toyota HiLux, and Isuzu D-MAX are frequently financed via chattel mortgage."}}]}`} />

          <h2 class="font-montserrat font-bold text-2xl md:text-3xl text-[#1e3a5f] mb-6">What Is a Chattel Mortgage?</h2>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">A chattel mortgage is a type of business finance where you purchase and own the asset (the "chattel") from day one, while the lender takes a mortgage (security interest) over the asset until the loan is repaid in full. It is the most commonly used finance structure for business vehicles and equipment in Australia because of its favourable tax treatment.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">The word "chattel" refers to personal property — as opposed to real property like land and buildings. So a chattel mortgage is essentially a mortgage over a moveable asset like a car, ute, truck, trailer, excavator, or piece of machinery. It works similarly to a home loan: you own the property, the lender has a registered security interest, and once you repay the loan in full, the security is discharged and you have clear ownership.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">Chattel mortgages are exclusively a business finance product — they are only available to ABN holders using the asset for business purposes (typically more than 50% business use). They are not available for purely personal purchases. If you need a vehicle for personal use, a consumer car loan is the appropriate product.</p>

        <section class="mb-16">
          <h2 class="font-montserrat font-bold text-2xl md:text-3xl text-[#1e3a5f] mb-6">Tax Benefits of a Chattel Mortgage</h2>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">The tax advantages of a chattel mortgage are the primary reason it is the most popular business vehicle and equipment finance structure in Australia. There are three key benefits:</p>

          <h3 class="font-montserrat font-semibold text-xl text-[#0d4d3e] mt-8 mb-4">1. GST Recovery</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">If you are registered for GST, you can claim the full GST component of the purchase price in your next Business Activity Statement (BAS) — regardless of the finance term. On a $55,000 vehicle (GST-inclusive), that is $5,000 back from the ATO in your next BAS cycle. This is a significant cash flow advantage compared to a hire purchase or lease where GST is claimed progressively over the term.</p>

          <h3 class="font-montserrat font-semibold text-xl text-[#0d4d3e] mt-8 mb-4">2. Interest Deductions</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">The interest portion of each repayment is fully tax-deductible as a business expense. Over the life of a typical chattel mortgage, the total interest deductions can be substantial. For example, on a $50,000 chattel mortgage at 6.5% p.a. over 5 years, the total interest is approximately $8,700 — all deductible against your business income.</p>

          <h3 class="font-montserrat font-semibold text-xl text-[#0d4d3e] mt-8 mb-4">3. Depreciation</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">Because you own the asset from day one, you can claim depreciation over its effective life. The ATO determines the effective life for different asset types — for example, a motor vehicle has an effective life of 8 years. You can use either the diminishing value or prime cost method. Additionally, the instant asset write-off may allow you to deduct the full cost immediately if your business qualifies (businesses with aggregated turnover under $10 million can instantly write off assets costing less than $20,000 each in the 2025–26 financial year).</p>

          <div class="bg-[#0d4d3e]/5 border-l-4 border-[#10b981] rounded-r-lg p-6 my-6">
            <p class="text-[#0d4d3e] font-lato font-light leading-relaxed"><strong>Important:</strong> Tax benefits depend on your individual circumstances. The FBT (Fringe Benefits Tax) exemption threshold for electric vehicles is $91,387 for the 2025–26 financial year. If you are considering an electric or plug-in hybrid vehicle for business, the FBT exemption can make a chattel mortgage even more attractive. Always consult your accountant for advice specific to your situation.</p>

          <h2 class="font-montserrat font-bold text-2xl md:text-3xl text-[#1e3a5f] mb-6">Chattel Mortgage vs Other Finance Structures</h2>

          <h3 class="font-montserrat font-semibold text-xl text-[#0d4d3e] mt-8 mb-4">Chattel Mortgage vs Hire Purchase</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">Both allow you to claim interest and depreciation. The key difference is GST treatment: with a chattel mortgage, you claim the full GST upfront in one BAS cycle. With hire purchase, GST is spread across each instalment over the term. If you are GST-registered and want the largest possible immediate cash flow benefit, chattel mortgage is typically preferred. If you prefer to spread GST payments, hire purchase may suit.</p>

          <h3 class="font-montserrat font-semibold text-xl text-[#0d4d3e] mt-8 mb-4">Chattel Mortgage vs Finance Lease</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">With a finance lease, the lender owns the asset and you have a right to use it. Lease payments are generally fully deductible, but you cannot claim depreciation (because you do not own it) or GST upfront. A finance lease keeps the asset off your balance sheet. For most GST-registered businesses buying vehicles or equipment they intend to keep, a chattel mortgage offers better overall tax outcomes.</p>

          <h3 class="font-montserrat font-semibold text-xl text-[#0d4d3e] mt-8 mb-4">Chattel Mortgage vs Consumer Car Loan</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">A consumer car loan is for personal use vehicles. You cannot claim tax deductions on interest, depreciation, or GST. A chattel mortgage is exclusively for business use. If the vehicle is used more than 50% for business, a chattel mortgage will almost always deliver a better after-tax outcome than a consumer car loan. If it is primarily personal, you must use a consumer loan.</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed">A car loan (consumer loan) is for personal use vehicles. You cannot claim tax deductions on interest or depreciation. A chattel mortgage is a business finance product — you can claim GST upfront, deduct interest as a business expense, and claim depreciation on the asset. Chattel mortgages require an ABN and business use of the asset.</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed">Yes. Most chattel mortgages allow a balloon (residual value) of up to 30–40% of the purchase price. This reduces your monthly repayments during the term. At the end, you pay the balloon to take full ownership, refinance the remaining amount, or trade the vehicle/equipment in. Setting a balloon is a popular strategy for managing business cash flow.</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed">If there is no balloon payment, you own the asset outright once the final repayment is made — the lender discharges their security interest on the PPSR. If you set a balloon, you have three options at the end of term: pay the balloon in cash to take full ownership, refinance the balloon amount into a new loan, or sell or trade the asset and use the proceeds to pay the balloon.</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed">Yes — chattel mortgages are the most common way Australian tradespeople and businesses finance work utes, vans, and trucks. The combination of GST recovery, interest deductions, and depreciation makes it highly tax-effective. Popular work vehicles like the Ford Ranger, Toyota HiLux, and Isuzu D-MAX are frequently financed via chattel mortgage.</p>
