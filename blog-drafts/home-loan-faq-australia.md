## Getting Started

### What is a home loan?
A home loan (mortgage) is a loan used to purchase property. The property serves as security for the loan, which you repay over typically 25-30 years.

### How do home loans work?
1. Save a deposit (typically 5-20% of property value)
2. Get pre-approved to know your budget
3. Find a property
4. Finalise the loan
5. Settlement – you get the keys
6. Make repayments until the loan is paid off

### What types of home loans are available?
- **Variable rate** – Rate moves with the market
- **Fixed rate** – Rate locked for 1-5 years
- **Split loan** – Part fixed, part variable
- **Interest-only** – Pay only interest for a period
- **Principal & interest** – Pay down the loan from day one
- **Line of credit** – Flexible access to equity

### What's the difference between pre-approval and formal approval?
**Pre-approval:** Conditional approval based on your finances. Valid for 3-6 months. Helps you shop with confidence.
**Formal approval:** Final approval after property selection, valuation, and full assessment.

## Deposits & Costs

### How much deposit do I need for a home loan?
- **Standard:** 20% (avoids LMI)
- **Low deposit:** 10-20% (LMI applies)
- **First home buyer schemes:** 5% (government guarantee)
- **Guarantor loans:** As low as 0%

### What is LMI (Lenders Mortgage Insurance)?
LMI protects the lender if you default. It's a one-off premium charged when your deposit is less than 20%. It can cost $10,000-$40,000+ depending on loan size.

### How can I avoid paying LMI?
- Save a 20% deposit
- Use the First Home Guarantee (5% deposit, no LMI)
- Get a family guarantee
- Some professions (doctors, lawyers) may be exempt

### What other costs are involved in buying a home?
- Stamp duty: $10,000-$50,000+ (varies by state)
- Legal/conveyancing: $1,500-$3,000
- Building & pest inspection: $500-$800
- Loan establishment fees: $0-$600
- Moving costs: $500-$2,000+
- Home insurance: Required from settlement

### Can I use gifted money for my deposit?
Yes. Most lenders accept gifted deposits from immediate family. You'll need a signed gift letter stating the money doesn't need to be repaid.

## Borrowing Power

### How much can I borrow for a home loan?
Generally 5-6 times your annual income, minus debts and expenses. A $100,000 income might borrow $500,000-$700,000, depending on circumstances.

### What affects my borrowing power?
- Income (type and amount)
- Existing debts (credit cards, loans)
- Living expenses
- Number of dependents
- Credit history
- Loan type (investment vs. owner-occupied)

### Do credit cards affect my borrowing power?
Yes. Lenders assess the credit limit (not balance). A $10,000 limit can reduce borrowing by $30,000-$50,000 even if the balance is zero.

### Can I borrow 100% of the property value?
Not typically, but guarantor loans can cover 100%+ by using family property as additional security.

## Interest Rates

### What are current home loan rates in Australia?
Rates fluctuate. As of 2026, typical rates range from 5.5% to 7%+ depending on LVR, loan type, and lender.

### Fixed or variable: which is better?
**Variable:** Flexibility to make extra repayments, benefit from rate drops
**Fixed:** Certainty, protection from rate rises
**Split:** Best of both worlds

### What is a comparison rate?
The comparison rate includes fees and charges, providing a more accurate cost picture than the headline rate. Always compare using comparison rates.

### Can I negotiate my interest rate?
Yes! Call your lender or use a broker to negotiate. Existing customers can often get better rates just by asking.

---

## Loan Features

### What is an offset account?
A savings account linked to your home loan. The balance "offsets" your loan, reducing interest. $50,000 in offset on a $500,000 loan means you only pay interest on $450,000.

### What is a redraw facility?
Allows you to access extra repayments you've made. Useful for emergencies, but funds must be withdrawn (not automatic like offset).

### What's the difference between offset and redraw?
- **Offset:** Separate account, funds always accessible, better for tax (investment loans)
- **Redraw:** Part of loan account, may have minimum withdrawal, can be restricted

### What is a split loan?
Dividing your loan between fixed and variable rates. For example, 50% fixed (certainty) and 50% variable (flexibility).

### What is interest-only?
You pay only the interest (not the principal) for a set period (usually 1-5 years). Useful for investors or temporary cash flow needs, but costs more long-term.

## First Home Buyers

### What grants are available for first home buyers?
- First Home Owner Grant (FHOG): $10,000-$30,000 (state-dependent)
- Stamp duty concessions
- First Home Guarantee (5% deposit scheme)
- First Home Super Saver Scheme

### What is the First Home Guarantee?
A federal government scheme allowing eligible first home buyers to purchase with 5% deposit without paying LMI. The government guarantees the remaining 15%.

### Am I eligible for first home buyer benefits?
Generally you must:
- Never have owned property in Australia
- Be an Australian citizen
- Meet income caps (for some schemes)
- Live in the property

### Can couples both claim first home buyer benefits?
Both parties must be first home buyers. If one has previously owned property, you may lose eligibility.

## Refinancing

### What is refinancing?
Replacing your current home loan with a new one, typically to get a better rate, access equity, or change loan features.

### When should I refinance?
Consider refinancing if:
- Your rate is 0.5%+ above market rates
- You haven't reviewed your loan in 2+ years
- You want to access equity
- You need different loan features
- Your circumstances have changed

### What does refinancing cost?
- Discharge fee (old lender): $150-$400
- Break costs (fixed loans): $0-$20,000+
- Application fee (new lender): Often waived
- Valuation fee: Often free
- Legal costs: $150-$300

### How long does refinancing take?
Typically 2-4 weeks from application to settlement.

## Special Situations

### Can I get a home loan if I'm self-employed?
Yes. You'll need:
- 2 years tax returns
- ATO Notice of Assessment
- Recent BAS statements
- Possibly an accountant's letter

### Can I get a home loan with bad credit?
Yes, through specialist lenders. Rates will be higher, and you may need a larger deposit.

### Can I get a home loan on a visa?
Some lenders accept visa holders, especially those on permanent visas. Options depend on visa type and duration.

### Can I get a home loan for an investment property?
Yes. Investment loans typically have slightly higher rates than owner-occupied. Interest may be tax deductible.

### What's a guarantor loan?
A family member uses their property as additional security for your loan, allowing you to borrow with a smaller deposit or avoid LMI.

## Repayments & Managing Your Loan

### What's the difference between principal and interest?
**Principal:** The amount you borrowed
**Interest:** The cost of borrowing
**P&I repayments:** Pay both, reducing your loan over time
**Interest-only:** Pay only interest, loan balance stays the same

### How can I pay off my home loan faster?
- Make extra repayments
- Use an offset account
- Round up repayments
- Make fortnightly instead of monthly payments
- Refinance to a lower rate

### Can I make extra repayments?
Variable loans usually allow unlimited extra repayments. Fixed loans may have limits (often $10,000-$30,000 per year).

### What happens if I miss a payment?
Contact your lender immediately. One missed payment isn't usually catastrophic, but repeated missed payments can lead to default and eventually foreclosure.

### Can I pause my home loan repayments?
Some lenders offer repayment pauses for hardship situations. Contact your lender to discuss options.

---

## Property Types

### Can I get a home loan for an apartment?
Yes, but some restrictions apply for:
- Very small apartments (<50sqm)
- High-density buildings
- Serviced apartments

### Can I get a home loan for a house and land package?
Yes, through construction loans or land-then-build arrangements.

### Can I get a home loan for rural property?
Yes, but options may be limited. Some lenders restrict rural lending, and valuations can be challenging.

### Can I get a home loan for a deceased estate?
Yes, standard lending applies once probate is granted.

---

## Investment Properties

### Is an investment loan different from a home loan?
Similar products, but investment loans typically have:
- Slightly higher interest rates
- Different tax treatment
- Stricter serviceability assessment

### Can I use equity to buy an investment property?
Yes. If your home has increased in value, you can refinance to access equity for an investment deposit.

### What is negative gearing?
When your investment property expenses (including interest) exceed rental income, creating a tax loss that reduces your taxable income.

### Can I have both a home loan and an investment loan?
Yes. Many Australians have multiple properties. Your total borrowing capacity applies across all loans.
