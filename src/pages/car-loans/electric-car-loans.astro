        <h2 class="font-montserrat font-bold text-2xl md:text-3xl text-[#1e3a5f] mb-6">Why Electric Vehicle Finance Is Different</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">Electric vehicles are treated differently by lenders for several important reasons. Many lenders offer discounted green car loan rates — typically 0.3–0.7% lower than standard rates — because EVs qualify as environmentally friendly assets. The lowest rate currently available for an EV-eligible loan is 5.09% p.a. (comparison rate 5.78%) from RACV, compared to 5.49% for a standard new car loan.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">Beyond rate discounts, the Australian Government's FBT exemption for eligible EVs under a novated lease can save employees thousands per year. This makes the total cost of ownership for an EV financed through a novated lease dramatically cheaper than it appears at sticker price. Nik Finance can help you assess whether a standard car loan, chattel mortgage, or novated lease is the best structure for your situation.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">EV sales in Australia are accelerating rapidly. In January 2026, 5,161 plug-in hybrids were sold (up 170.5% year-on-year), and petrol vehicle sales fell 14%. Around 40% of lenders in Australia now offer a specific discounted rate for electric or green vehicles.</p>

        <h2 class="font-montserrat font-bold text-2xl md:text-3xl text-[#1e3a5f] mb-6">EV Finance Options Compared</h2>
        <h3 class="font-montserrat font-semibold text-xl text-[#0d4d3e] mt-8 mb-4">Standard Green Car Loan (Personal Use)</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">A secured car loan at a discounted rate for qualifying electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles. Rates from 5.09% p.a. This is the simplest option for personal buyers — fixed repayments, you own the car, no employer involvement required.</p>
        <h3 class="font-montserrat font-semibold text-xl text-[#0d4d3e] mt-8 mb-4">Novated Lease With FBT Exemption (Salary Sacrifice)</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">The most tax-effective option for salaried employees. Lease payments and running costs are deducted from pre-tax salary. The FBT exemption means the full payment comes from pre-tax income with no fringe benefits tax payable. On a $60,000 EV with a $100,000 salary, savings can exceed $10,000–$15,000 over a 5-year lease compared to buying with a standard car loan after tax.</p>
        <div class="bg-[#0d4d3e]/5 border-l-4 border-[#10b981] rounded-r-lg p-6 my-6"><p class="text-[#0d4d3e] font-lato font-light leading-relaxed">Important: from 1 April 2025, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) are no longer eligible for the FBT exemption on new leases. Only battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles qualify for new arrangements. Existing PHEV leases entered before this date retain the exemption for the duration of their original lease term.</p></div>
        <h3 class="font-montserrat font-semibold text-xl text-[#0d4d3e] mt-8 mb-4">Chattel Mortgage (Business Use)</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">If you are self-employed or the vehicle is used primarily for business, a chattel mortgage lets you claim GST on purchase, deduct interest, and depreciate the vehicle. For a $65,000 EV, GST recovery alone is approximately $5,909. Combined with interest deductions and depreciation, the effective cost drops significantly.</p>

        <h2 class="font-montserrat font-bold text-2xl md:text-3xl text-[#1e3a5f] mb-6">EV Ownership Costs vs Petrol</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">Beyond the purchase price and finance rate, EVs have significantly lower running costs. Electricity costs approximately $2–$4 per 100km compared to $12–$18 per 100km for petrol. Servicing costs are 30–50% lower because EVs have far fewer moving parts — no oil changes, no timing belts, no exhaust system, and regenerative braking reduces brake wear.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">When you factor in lower running costs, potential FBT savings through a novated lease, green car loan discounts, and state-based incentives (where available), an EV can be cheaper on a total-cost-of-ownership basis than a comparable petrol vehicle despite a higher purchase price.</p>
        <div class="bg-[#0d4d3e]/5 border-l-4 border-[#10b981] rounded-r-lg p-6 my-6"><p class="text-[#0d4d3e] font-lato font-light leading-relaxed">Example: A Tesla Model 3 at $55,000 via novated lease on a $100,000 salary costs approximately $550–$650 per fortnight from pre-tax income, including all running costs. A comparable $45,000 petrol sedan via standard car loan costs approximately $500–$600 per fortnight from after-tax income, plus fuel and servicing on top. The EV can end up costing less despite the higher sticker price.</p></div>
