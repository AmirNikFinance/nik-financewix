## What is Equipment Finance?

Equipment finance (also called asset finance) allows businesses to purchase or lease equipment without paying the full cost upfront. The equipment itself typically serves as security for the loan.

## Types of Equipment Finance

### 1. Chattel Mortgage
You own the equipment from day one. The lender holds a mortgage over the asset until the loan is repaid.

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Ownership | You own the asset immediately |
| GST | Claim GST credit upfront |
| Tax | Interest and depreciation deductible |
| End of term | Asset is yours outright |
| Best for | GST-registered businesses |

### 2. Finance Lease
The lender owns the equipment and leases it to you. At the end, you can purchase it for a residual value.

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Ownership | Lender owns until residual paid |
| GST | Pay GST on each payment |
| Tax | Lease payments deductible |
| End of term | Pay residual to own, refinance, or return |
| Best for | Businesses wanting lower payments |

### 3. Operating Lease (Rental)
Rent equipment for a period without ownership obligations.

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Ownership | Never yours |
| Payments | 100% tax deductible |
| End of term | Return equipment |
| Best for | Short-term needs, rapidly depreciating tech |

### 4. Hire Purchase
Similar to chattel mortgage. You hire the equipment with the option to purchase at the end.

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Ownership | Yours after final payment |
| GST | Claim GST on purchase price |
| Tax | Interest and depreciation deductible |
| Best for | Non-GST registered businesses |

### 5. Rent-to-Own
Make rental payments with ownership transferring at the end.

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Ownership | Yours after rental period |
| Best for | Businesses with cash flow constraints |
