For salaried employees in the 32.5%+ tax bracket leasing an FBT-exempt EV, a novated lease is significantly cheaper. For personal buyers not eligible for salary packaging, a car loan is usually the better option."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Do I own the car at the end of a lease?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Not automatically. At the end of a novated or finance lease, you must pay the residual value to take ownership. With a car loan, you own the car from day one and there is nothing to pay at the end (unless you chose a balloon payment)."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is the residual value?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The residual is a lump sum due at the end of a lease or a loan with a balloon payment. For leases, the ATO sets minimum residual percentages based on the lease term. You can pay it in cash, refinance it, or trade the vehicle in. A higher residual reduces regular payments but means a larger sum at the end."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I salary sacrifice a car loan instead of a novated lease?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Not effectively. While some employers allow salary sacrifice of car loan repayments, the FBT implications make this less tax-effective than a properly structured novated lease. Salary sacrificing a car loan does not provide the same GST savings or bundled running cost benefits."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What about operating leases?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"An operating lease is a fully maintained rental arrangement used primarily by businesses for fleet vehicles. The leasing company owns the vehicle, handles all maintenance and running costs, and you return the vehicle at the end. There is no ownership transfer. Operating leases are uncommon for individual buyers."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Which is best for an electric vehicle?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"For salaried employees, a novated lease with the FBT exemption is the clear winner for EVs. For self-employed or business use, a chattel mortgage offers GST recovery and depreciation. For personal use without salary packaging, a green car loan offers discounted rates from 5.09% p.a."}}]}`} />

        <h2 class="font-montserrat font-bold text-2xl md:text-3xl text-[#1e3a5f] mb-6">Understanding the Options</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">In Australia, there are four main ways to finance a vehicle: a car loan (secured or unsecured), a novated lease (for salaried employees), a finance lease (for business), and a chattel mortgage (for business). Each has different implications for ownership, tax, cash flow, and flexibility. The operating lease is a fifth option, used primarily for fleet management. Understanding the differences is essential for making the right choice.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">A car loan is the simplest and most common option for personal vehicle purchases in Australia. You borrow money, buy the car, own it from day one, and repay the loan over 1-7 years. Once the loan is paid off, the car is yours free and clear. There are no residual payments, no balloon requirements, and no restrictions on vehicle use or modifications. You can sell the car at any time (with lender consent if secured). For the majority of Australian personal car buyers, a standard secured car loan is the right choice.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">A novated lease is a salary sacrifice arrangement available only to salaried employees. Your employer deducts lease payments and running costs from your pre-tax salary, reducing your taxable income. For eligible battery electric vehicles, the FBT exemption makes this the most tax-effective vehicle finance option available in Australia. For petrol and diesel vehicles, the tax savings are smaller but still meaningful for employees in higher tax brackets (32.5%+).</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">A finance lease is a business finance product. The finance company buys the vehicle and leases it to your business. You make regular lease payments plus a residual (balloon) at the end. The vehicle does not appear on your balance sheet (off-balance-sheet finance). GST is claimed progressively on lease payments. At the end of the lease, you either pay the residual to own the car, refinance, or return it.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">A chattel mortgage is also for business use. You own the vehicle from day one, and the lender holds a mortgage over it. You claim GST on purchase upfront (in your next BAS), deduct interest, and depreciate the vehicle. Most popular structure for ABN holders, sole traders, and businesses that want immediate ownership and maximum upfront tax benefits.</p>

        <h2 class="font-montserrat font-bold text-2xl md:text-3xl text-[#1e3a5f] mb-6">Side-by-Side Comparison</h2>
        <h3 class="font-montserrat font-semibold text-xl text-[#0d4d3e] mt-8 mb-4">Ownership</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">Car loan: you own the vehicle from day one. Novated lease: the leasing company owns the vehicle during the lease; you own it after paying the residual. Finance lease: the finance company owns the vehicle; you purchase it at the end by paying the residual. Chattel mortgage: you own the vehicle from day one (lender holds a mortgage).</p>
        <h3 class="font-montserrat font-semibold text-xl text-[#0d4d3e] mt-8 mb-4">Who Can Use It</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">Car loan: anyone — employees, self-employed, retirees, Centrelink recipients. Novated lease: salaried employees only, with employer agreement. Finance lease: businesses with an ABN. Chattel mortgage: businesses with an ABN (GST-registered for GST claims).</p>
        <h3 class="font-montserrat font-semibold text-xl text-[#0d4d3e] mt-8 mb-4">Tax Treatment</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">Car loan (personal): no tax deductions — interest and depreciation are not deductible for personal use. Novated lease: payments from pre-tax salary reduce taxable income; EVs are FBT-exempt; running costs also salary sacrificed. Finance lease: lease payments are deductible; GST claimed on payments; residual is not deductible. Chattel mortgage: interest deductible; GST claimed upfront on purchase; vehicle depreciated over effective life (8 years for cars).</p>
        <h3 class="font-montserrat font-semibold text-xl text-[#0d4d3e] mt-8 mb-4">GST</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">Car loan (personal): you pay GST on the purchase price. Novated lease: no GST on purchase price (saving approximately 10%). Finance lease: GST claimed progressively on each lease payment. Chattel mortgage: full GST claimed upfront in your next BAS — on a $60,000 vehicle, that is approximately $5,454 back immediately.</p>
        <h3 class="font-montserrat font-semibold text-xl text-[#0d4d3e] mt-8 mb-4">End of Term</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">Car loan: car is yours, nothing more to pay. Novated lease: pay the residual to own the car, start a new lease, or return the vehicle. Finance lease: pay the residual, refinance, or return. Chattel mortgage: pay the optional balloon (if applicable), or the car is already fully owned if no balloon was set.</p>

For salaried employees in the 32.5%+ tax bracket leasing an FBT-exempt EV, a novated lease is significantly cheaper. For personal buyers not eligible for salary packaging, a car loan is usually the better option.</p></div></details>
        <details class="group border border-gray-200 rounded-xl overflow-hidden mt-3"><summary class="flex items-center justify-between cursor-pointer p-6 bg-white hover:bg-gray-50 transition-colors"><h3 class="font-montserrat font-semibold text-[#1e3a5f] pr-8 text-left">Do I own the car at the end of a lease?</h3><svg class="w-5 h-5 text-[#10b981] flex-shrink-0 group-open:rotate-180 transition-transform" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M19 9l-7 7-7-7"/></svg></summary><div class="p-6 pt-0 border-t border-gray-100"><p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed">Not automatically. At the end of a novated or finance lease, you must pay the residual value to take ownership. With a car loan, you own the car from day one and there is nothing to pay at the end (unless you chose a balloon payment).</p></div></details>
        <details class="group border border-gray-200 rounded-xl overflow-hidden mt-3"><summary class="flex items-center justify-between cursor-pointer p-6 bg-white hover:bg-gray-50 transition-colors"><h3 class="font-montserrat font-semibold text-[#1e3a5f] pr-8 text-left">What is the residual value?</h3><svg class="w-5 h-5 text-[#10b981] flex-shrink-0 group-open:rotate-180 transition-transform" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M19 9l-7 7-7-7"/></svg></summary><div class="p-6 pt-0 border-t border-gray-100"><p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed">The residual is a lump sum due at the end of a lease or a loan with a balloon payment. For leases, the ATO sets minimum residual percentages based on the lease term. You can pay it in cash, refinance it, or trade the vehicle in. A higher residual reduces regular payments but means a larger sum at the end.</p></div></details>

While some employers allow salary sacrifice of car loan repayments, the FBT implications make this less tax-effective than a properly structured novated lease. Salary sacrificing a car loan does not provide the same GST savings or bundled running cost benefits.</p></div></details>
