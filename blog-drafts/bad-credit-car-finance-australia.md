## Can You Get Car Finance with Bad Credit?

Yes. While mainstream lenders may decline you, specialist lenders in Australia work with borrowers who have:

- ✅ Past defaults
- ✅ Low credit scores
- ✅ Discharged bankruptcies
- ✅ Part IX debt agreements
- ✅ Payday loan history
- ✅ Multiple credit enquiries

## Bad Credit Car Finance Rates

Expect higher rates than prime lending, but options exist across credit profiles:

| Credit Situation | Typical Rate Range |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Minor credit issues | 12% - 16% |
| Defaults (paid) | 14% - 20% |
| Defaults (unpaid) | 18% - 25% |
| Discharged bankruptcy | 16% - 24% |
| Current Part IX | 20% - 28% |

*Rates depend on your complete situation. Better rates possible with larger deposits.*

## What Lenders Look At

Bad credit lenders focus on:

### Current Situation (Most Important)
- Current income and stability
- Recent bank statement conduct
- Ability to afford repayments
- Living situation

### Credit History (Less Weight)
- Age of credit issues
- Size of defaults
- Whether issues are paid or unpaid
- Explanation for problems

## How to Improve Your Chances

### 1. Save a Larger Deposit
20-30% deposit significantly improves approval odds and rates.

### 2. Show Stable Income
3+ months in current job, regular income deposits.

### 3. Clean Recent Conduct
No overdrafts, no dishonours, positive bank balance.

### 4. Pay Small Defaults
Defaults under $500-$1,000 are often worth paying before applying.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How bad can my credit be?
We've helped clients with credit scores under 400, multiple defaults, and discharged bankruptcies. There's usually an option.

### Will applying hurt my credit score more?
We minimise enquiries by matching you with suitable lenders first. One targeted application is better than multiple rejections.

### Can I refinance later at a better rate?
Yes. 12-24 months of on-time payments can significantly improve your options. We help clients refinance to better rates once their credit improves.

### What if I'm currently bankrupt?
Options are very limited during bankruptcy. We can help once you're discharged.

### Can I get finance on Centrelink?
Some bad credit lenders accept Centrelink income. Loan amounts may be limited.

## Rebuild Your Credit

A bad credit car loan can actually help rebuild your score:

1. **Make payments on time** – Payment history is crucial
2. **Don't miss payments** – Set up direct debit
3. **Keep the loan** – Length of credit history matters
4. **Refinance later** – Improve your rate once credit improves
