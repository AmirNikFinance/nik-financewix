## The Big Question: Broker or Bank?

When you need a loan – whether for a car, home, or business – you have two main options: go directly to a bank, or use a finance broker. Here's everything you need to know to make the right choice.

## What's the Difference?

### Bank (Direct)
You approach a single lender directly. They offer only their own products at their set rates.

### Finance Broker
An intermediary who compares multiple lenders on your behalf to find the best deal for your situation.

## Quick Comparison

| Factor | Bank (Direct) | Finance Broker |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| Number of options | 1 lender | 20-130+ lenders |
| Rate negotiation | Limited | Extensive |
| Convenience | Visit branch/apply online | One application, many options |
| Advice | Product-focused | Needs-focused |
| Cost to you | Free | Usually free (paid by lender) |
| Time required | Research each bank yourself | Broker does the comparison |
| Specialist situations | May not fit their criteria | Can find specialist lenders |

## Why 70% of Australians Choose Brokers

The mortgage broker market share has grown from 45% to over 70% in the past decade. Here's why:

### 1. Access to More Options
A bank offers only their products. A broker compares dozens or hundreds of lenders, including:
- Major banks (CBA, ANZ, NAB, Westpac)
- Second-tier banks (Macquarie, ING, Bankwest)
- Credit unions
- Non-bank lenders
- Specialist lenders

### 2. Better Rates
Brokers often have access to exclusive rates not available to the public. They also know which lenders are hungry for business and offering the best deals.

### 3. Time Savings
Instead of researching and applying to multiple banks yourself, a broker does the legwork. One application can be submitted to multiple lenders.

### 4. Expert Guidance
Brokers navigate complex situations daily. They know:
- Which lenders suit your situation
- How to structure your application
- What documentation you need
- How to maximise approval chances

### 5. Advocacy
Your broker works for you, not the lender. They'll negotiate on your behalf and fight for the best deal.

### 6. Specialist Situations
Banks have strict criteria. If you're self-employed, have credit issues, or have a complex income situation, a broker can find lenders who specialise in your circumstances.

## When Going Direct to a Bank Might Make Sense

Direct banking can work if:

- ✅ You have a long relationship with your bank
- ✅ Your bank is offering a genuinely competitive deal
- ✅ Your situation is straightforward
- ✅ You've already compared with a broker and your bank beats them
- ✅ You want a specific bank product with unique features

## The Cost Myth: "Brokers Are More Expensive"

**Fact: Brokers are usually FREE for borrowers.**

Brokers are paid a commission by the lender when your loan settles. This commission is built into all loans (whether you use a broker or not), so you're not paying extra by using a broker.

In fact, brokers often save you money by:
- Finding lower rates
- Negotiating better terms
- Avoiding costly mistakes

## Real-World Comparison

### Scenario: $500,000 Home Loan

**Direct to Bank A:**
- Rate offered: 6.5%
- Monthly repayment: $3,160
- Total interest (30 years): $637,588

**Through Broker (finds Bank B):**
- Rate: 6.0%
- Monthly repayment: $2,998
- Total interest (30 years): $579,191

**Savings using a broker: $58,397** 🎉

## What About Loyalty?

Many people stay with their bank out of loyalty. But here's the truth:

> "Banks don't reward loyalty – they reward negotiation."

Existing customers often pay a "loyalty tax" – higher rates than new customers. A broker can help you:
- Negotiate with your current bank
- Or find a better deal elsewhere

## Types of Loans: Broker Advantage

### Home Loans
Brokers dominate this market. With hundreds of products available, professional comparison is essential.

### Car Loans
Dealers often charge 2-5% more than broker rates. Always get a broker quote before accepting dealer finance.

### Business Loans
Business lending is complex. Brokers know which lenders suit different industries and situations.

### Personal Loans
Rate variation is huge (7% to 25%+). A broker finds lenders suited to your credit profile.

## How Brokers Get Paid

Understanding broker compensation:

### Upfront Commission
Lenders pay brokers a percentage of the loan amount when the loan settles (typically 0.5-0.7% for mortgages).

### Trail Commission
Ongoing small percentage while the loan remains active (typically 0.15-0.2% annually for mortgages).

### Why This Matters
- You don't pay directly
- Commission is the same regardless of which lender
- Good brokers recommend the best product, not the highest commission
- Trail commission incentivises ongoing service

## Choosing a Good Broker

Not all brokers are equal. Look for:

✅ **Licensed** – Australian Credit Licence or authorised representative
✅ **Access to many lenders** – More options = better outcomes
✅ **Experience** – Industry knowledge matters
✅ **Reviews** – Check Google, testimonials
✅ **Specialisation** – Match to your loan type
✅ **Communication** – Responsive and clear
✅ **No pressure** – Takes time to understand your needs

## Common Broker Myths Debunked

### Myth 1: "Brokers push loans that pay them more"
**Reality:** Commissions are similar across lenders. Good brokers recommend based on fit, not commission.

### Myth 2: "Banks offer better rates directly"
**Reality:** Brokers often access exclusive rates. Banks rarely beat broker-sourced deals.

### Myth 3: "Using a broker takes longer"
**Reality:** Brokers streamline the process. They know exactly what each lender needs.

### Myth 4: "I have to pay the broker"
**Reality:** Brokers are free for most borrowers (paid by lenders).

### Myth 5: "My bank knows me best"
**Reality:** Your bank knows their products. A broker knows the entire market.

## The Verdict

For most Australians, using a finance broker is the smarter choice:

| Situation | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|
| First home buyer | ✅ Use a broker |
| Refinancing | ✅ Use a broker |
| Car finance | ✅ Use a broker |
