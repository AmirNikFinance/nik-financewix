  cityDescription="Perth's vast urban footprint, stretching over 120 kilometres from Two Rocks in the north to Mandurah in the south, makes car ownership virtually essential. The city's reliance on private transport, combined with high incomes from the mining and resources sector, drives strong vehicle purchasing activity. NIK Finance helps Perth drivers access better rates than what dealerships along Albany Highway or Scarborough Beach Road typically offer. Our AI technology is particularly effective for FIFO workers and mining contractors, matching them with lenders who recognise fluctuating shift patterns, overtime income, and living-away-from-home allowances. We also arrange finance for 4WDs and heavy-duty vehicles popular with Perth's outdoor and remote-access lifestyle."
