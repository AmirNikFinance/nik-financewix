        <h2 class="font-montserrat font-bold text-2xl md:text-3xl text-[#1e3a5f] mb-6">How Dealer Finance Works</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">When you buy a car from a dealership, the dealer will almost always offer to arrange finance for you. This is called dealer finance or dealership finance. The dealer acts as an intermediary between you and a finance provider — they do not lend the money themselves. Instead, they have arrangements with one or more lenders and submit your application on your behalf.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">Dealer finance is big business. For many dealerships, the finance and insurance (F&I) department is one of their most profitable areas. Dealers earn commission from the finance provider on every loan they arrange. This commission can be a flat fee, a percentage of the loan amount, or — critically — a margin above the lender's base rate. This last model is where dealer finance can become expensive for the consumer.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">Here is how the rate margin model works: a lender might offer the dealer a base rate of 6.00% p.a. The dealer then has the discretion to add a margin — say 2% — making your rate 8.00% p.a. The dealer keeps the extra margin as commission. On a $35,000 loan over 5 years, that 2% margin costs you approximately $1,900 in additional interest. You would never know the base rate was lower because the dealer is not required to disclose the margin.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">This practice is legal in Australia. The National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009 requires responsible lending but does not mandate that dealers offer you the lowest available rate. The dealer is required to ensure the finance is "not unsuitable" for you, but that is a much lower bar than "the best deal available".</p>

        <h2 class="font-montserrat font-bold text-2xl md:text-3xl text-[#1e3a5f] mb-6">How Broker Finance Works</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">A finance broker is an independent intermediary who compares loan options from multiple lenders on your behalf. Unlike a dealer, a broker is not tied to a single dealership or a small panel of finance providers. Nik Finance, for example, compares options from over 130 lenders including major banks like NAB, St George, and Macquarie, credit unions, specialist vehicle finance lenders, and non-conforming lenders for borrowers with impaired credit.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">A broker submits a single application and then identifies the most competitive option from their lender panel based on your credit profile, income, loan amount, and vehicle details. The broker earns a commission from the lender on settlement — you pay nothing for the broker's service. The key difference is that the broker's commission is typically a flat rate or a fixed percentage of the loan amount, not a variable margin on top of the rate. This means the broker has no incentive to inflate your rate.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">Importantly, a broker consultation happens away from the dealership. There is no salesperson sitting across the desk, no pressure to sign today, and no tying of the finance decision to the vehicle purchase decision. This separation of the buying decision and the finance decision is one of the most valuable aspects of using a broker.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">Nik Finance also provides a pre-approval service. This means you walk into the dealership already knowing your budget, your rate, and your repayments. You can negotiate purely on the vehicle price without worrying about finance. If the dealer offers to beat your pre-approved rate, great — use their finance. If they cannot, you already have approval ready to go.</p>

        <h2 class="font-montserrat font-bold text-2xl md:text-3xl text-[#1e3a5f] mb-6">Dealer Finance vs Broker: Detailed Comparison</h2>
        <h3 class="font-montserrat font-semibold text-xl text-[#0d4d3e] mt-8 mb-4">Interest Rates</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">Dealer finance rates are often 1-4% higher than what you could arrange independently through a broker, due to the rate margin model. However, dealers sometimes offer manufacturer-subsidised promotional rates (often called "drive-away" or "1.9% finance" deals) that undercut broker rates on specific new models. These promotional rates are genuinely competitive when available, but they often come with restrictions — specific models only, maximum loan terms, no balloon payments, and sometimes mandatory dealer add-ons like paint protection or extended warranty.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">Broker rates reflect the lender's actual rate for your credit profile. There is no hidden margin. The RBA reports the average fixed-term personal lending rate at 9.68% p.a. across the market. The best secured rate available through a broker is currently 4.99% p.a., and the average car loan rate for prime borrowers through broker channels is approximately 7.20% p.a.</p>
        <h3 class="font-montserrat font-semibold text-xl text-[#0d4d3e] mt-8 mb-4">Range of Options</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">A dealer typically works with 2-5 finance providers. A broker compares options from 130+ lenders. For borrowers with excellent credit, this difference may be minor — most lenders will offer a competitive rate. For borrowers with any complexity (self-employed, bad credit, unusual vehicle, large loan amount, specific structure like chattel mortgage), a broker's wider panel makes a significant difference because specialist lenders are often not available through dealers.</p>
        <h3 class="font-montserrat font-semibold text-xl text-[#0d4d3e] mt-8 mb-4">Speed and Convenience</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">This is where dealer finance has a genuine advantage. You can arrange finance on the spot, same day, while you are at the dealership. For some buyers, this convenience is valuable. Broker finance requires a separate application process — typically 24-48 hours for pre-approval, though initial assessments can be provided in minutes. If you plan ahead and get pre-approved before visiting the dealer, the speed advantage disappears.</p>
        <h3 class="font-montserrat font-semibold text-xl text-[#0d4d3e] mt-8 mb-4">Transparency</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">Broker finance is generally more transparent. A broker shows you the rate, the comparison rate, all fees, and the total cost of the loan. Dealer finance can be less transparent — the focus is often on the monthly repayment rather than the total cost. A lower monthly repayment might disguise a longer term, a large balloon payment, or a higher interest rate. Always compare the total amount repayable, not just the monthly figure.</p>
        <h3 class="font-montserrat font-semibold text-xl text-[#0d4d3e] mt-8 mb-4">Pressure and Objectivity</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">Dealer finance is arranged in a high-pressure sales environment. The dealer has already invested time in the vehicle sale and wants to close the deal, including the finance, today. This pressure can lead to suboptimal decisions. A broker consultation is separate, objective, and low-pressure. You can take your time, ask questions, and compare options without a salesperson waiting in the next room.</p>

        <h2 class="font-montserrat font-bold text-2xl md:text-3xl text-[#1e3a5f] mb-6">The Best Strategy: Use Both</h2>
        <div class="bg-[#0d4d3e]/5 border-l-4 border-[#10b981] rounded-r-lg p-6 my-6"><p class="text-[#0d4d3e] font-lato font-light leading-relaxed">The winning strategy is simple: get pre-approved through a broker first, then challenge the dealer to beat your rate. If the dealer can beat it (e.g., with a manufacturer-subsidised promotional rate), use their finance. If they cannot, you already have approval ready. Either way, you get the best deal.</p></div>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">This approach gives you the negotiating power of a pre-approval, the wide market comparison of a broker, and the option to capture any genuine dealer promotions that happen to undercut the market. It costs you nothing — the broker service is free, and pre-approval creates only a single credit enquiry.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">Nik Finance provides this exact service. We start with a soft credit check (no impact to your credit score), compare options from 130+ lenders, and provide a formal pre-approval if you choose to proceed. We also review any dealer finance offer you receive and provide an honest comparison so you can make an informed decision.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">We understand that some buyers value the convenience of dealer finance and are happy to pay a small premium for it. That is a valid choice. Our role is to ensure you are making that choice knowingly, with a clear understanding of the cost difference.</p>

You negotiate on vehicle price only, not finance. If the dealer can beat your rate, use their finance. If not, you already have approval. This approach consistently saves buyers money and removes the pressure of the finance decision from the dealership.</p></div></details>
