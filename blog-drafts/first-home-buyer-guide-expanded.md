- **LMI cost:** $4,000-$8,000

### Option 3: 20% Deposit (no LMI)

## What Lenders Look For in First Home Buyers

### 1. Genuine Savings
Most lenders want to see **3+ months of genuine savings** — money you've saved yourself, not gifts. This demonstrates financial discipline.

### 2. Stable Employment
- Permanent employees: 6+ months in current role
- Casual/contract: 12+ months employment history
- Self-employed: 2 years of tax returns

### 3. Clean Credit History
- No defaults or late payments
- Credit cards not maxed out
- No recent credit applications

### 4. Serviceability
Lenders assess whether you can afford repayments if interest rates rise. They typically add 2-3% to the current rate as a buffer.

## Fixed vs Variable: Which Should First Home Buyers Choose?

### Fixed Rate
✅ **Pros:**
- Predictable repayments
- Protected if rates rise
- Easier budgeting

❌ **Cons:**
- Miss out if rates fall
- Break fees if you sell or refinance
- Usually can't make extra repayments

### Variable Rate
✅ **Pros:**
- Benefit if rates fall
- Make extra repayments
- Flexibility to refinance

❌ **Cons:**
- Payments can increase
- Harder to budget
- Rate changes are unpredictable

### Split Loan (Best of Both)
Many first home buyers choose a split loan:
- 50% fixed for stability
- 50% variable for flexibility

## Step-by-Step: How to Buy Your First Home

### Step 1: Check Your Borrowing Power
Before you start looking at properties, know your budget. Get a free assessment from Nik Finance — we'll tell you exactly how much you can borrow based on your income and expenses.

### Step 2: Get Pre-Approval
Pre-approval (or conditional approval) gives you:
- Confidence to make offers
- Faster settlement once you find a property
- Clearer budget for house hunting

Pre-approval typically lasts 3-6 months.

### Step 3: Research Grants and Schemes
Based on your state and property type:
- First Home Owner Grant
- Stamp duty exemptions
- First Home Guarantee
- Family Home Guarantee (if applicable)

### Step 4: Find Your Property
Look for properties within:
- Your pre-approved budget
- Grant eligibility caps
- Areas with growth potential

### Step 5: Make an Offer
Once you find the right property:
- Building and pest inspection
- Review contract with conveyancer
- Negotiate price
- Exchange contracts

### Step 6: Formal Loan Approval
After your offer is accepted:
- Submit full loan application
- Lender values the property
- Final approval issued
- Prepare for settlement

### Step 7: Settlement Day
Typically 30-90 days after exchange:
- Funds transferred
- Keys handed over
- You're officially a homeowner!

## Common Mistakes First Home Buyers Make

### 1. Not Getting Pre-Approval First
You might fall in love with a property you can't afford. Always know your borrowing power before you start looking.

### 2. Only Comparing Interest Rates
Comparison rates include fees and give a truer picture. A low rate with high fees can cost more than a higher rate with no fees.

### 3. Forgetting About Government Incentives
Thousands of first home buyers miss out on grants and stamp duty savings simply because they didn't know they existed.

### 4. Stretching the Budget Too Far
Just because a bank will lend you $800,000 doesn't mean you should borrow that much. Leave buffer for rate rises and unexpected costs.

### 5. Not Using a Broker
Banks only offer their own products. A broker like Nik Finance compares 130+ lenders to find you the best deal — at no cost to you.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much can I borrow as a first home buyer?
Most lenders will lend 80-90% of the property value. Your borrowing power depends on your income, expenses, existing debts, and deposit size. Use our free calculator or speak to a Nik Finance broker for an accurate assessment.

### Can I use gifted funds for my deposit?
Yes, most lenders accept gifted funds from immediate family members. You'll typically need a signed gift letter confirming the money doesn't need to be repaid.

### What credit score do I need for a home loan?
Most lenders prefer a credit score above 600. Scores above 700 will qualify you for better rates. You can check your score free at Credit Savvy or ClearScore.

### How long does home loan approval take?
Pre-approval: 1-3 business days
Full approval: 3-7 business days (varies by lender)
Settlement: 30-90 days after exchange

### Can I buy a home while on a visa?
Yes, but it's more complex. Temporary visa holders can purchase property with FIRB approval. Permanent residents have the same rights as citizens.

### What's the difference between pre-approval and formal approval?
Pre-approval is conditional — based on the information you've provided. Formal approval is after the lender has verified everything and valued the property.
