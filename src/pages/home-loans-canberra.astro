  cityDescription="Canberra's property market is underpinned by the stability of public sector employment and some of Australia's highest average household incomes. The ACT's planned urban design means property values differ markedly between established suburbs like Griffith and Red Hill, newer developments in Molonglo Valley and Gungahlin, and the apartment market in the CBD and Woden. Canberra's leasehold land system and unique stamp duty reform, which is gradually replacing stamp duty with an annual land tax, create specific considerations for buyers. NIK Finance helps Canberra purchasers navigate ACT-specific incentives including the Home Buyer Concession Scheme, which eliminates stamp duty for eligible first home buyers, and identifies lenders comfortable with Canberra's crown lease arrangements."

  faqs={[
    { question: "What are current home loan rates in Canberra?", answer: "Canberra home loan rates are comparable to national averages. Variable rates typically start from around 5.5%, with your actual rate depending on your deposit, loan type, and financial profile. NIK Finance compares 130+ lenders to find the best rate for your situation." },
    { question: "What is the ACT Home Buyer Concession Scheme?", answer: "The ACT Home Buyer Concession Scheme provides full stamp duty exemption for eligible first home buyers purchasing properties up to certain thresholds. The ACT is also progressively replacing stamp duty with annual land tax for all properties. NIK Finance helps you understand how these changes affect your purchase." },
    { question: "Does Canberra's leasehold system affect home loans?", answer: "Canberra operates on a crown lease system rather than freehold title. Most lenders are comfortable with ACT crown leases, but some have specific policies. NIK Finance identifies lenders who readily accept Canberra leasehold properties." },
    { question: "How does public sector income help with Canberra home loans?", answer: "Canberra's high proportion of stable public sector employment is viewed favourably by lenders. Government employees often access stronger borrowing capacity due to job security and consistent income. Our AI matches you with lenders who maximise this advantage." },
