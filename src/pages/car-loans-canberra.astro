  heroDescription="Looking for car finance in Canberra? NIK Finance compares car loan products from 130+ lenders to find competitive rates for your new or used vehicle purchase in Canberra."
  cityDescription="Canberra's planned city design and dispersed town centre layout, from Belconnen and Gungahlin in the north to Tuggeranong and Woden in the south, makes car ownership essential for most ACT residents despite improvements to light rail. With high average household incomes and stable public sector employment, Canberra residents are well-positioned to secure competitive car finance. NIK Finance helps Canberra buyers navigate beyond dealership finance offerings along Melrose Drive and Phillip's Hindmarsh Drive corridor to access better rates from our 130+ lender panel. The ACT's leadership in electric vehicle registration, supported by zero-interest EV loans from the ACT Government and abolished stamp duty for EVs, makes Canberra one of Australia's top markets for green vehicle finance, and our team connects you with lenders offering the best EV rates."
