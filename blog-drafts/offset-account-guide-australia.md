## What is an Offset Account?

An offset account is a transaction account linked to your home loan. The balance in your offset account is "offset" against your loan balance, reducing the interest you pay.

## How Does an Offset Account Work?

### Simple Example
- **Home loan:** $500,000 at 6%
- **Offset balance:** $50,000
- **Interest charged on:** $450,000 (not $500,000)

You save interest on the offset amount without actually paying down your loan.

### The Math
Without offset: $500,000 × 6% = $30,000/year interest
With $50,000 offset: $450,000 × 6% = $27,000/year interest
**Annual savings: $3,000**

## Full Offset vs. Partial Offset

### 100% Offset (Full)
Every dollar in the account reduces your loan dollar-for-dollar. This is the most common and valuable type.

### Partial Offset
Only a percentage of your balance offsets. Less valuable – check the terms carefully.

**Always choose 100% offset if available.**

## How Much Can You Save?

| Loan Amount | Offset Balance | Interest Rate | Annual Savings |
|-------------|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| $400,000 | $20,000 | 6% | $1,200 |
| $500,000 | $50,000 | 6% | $3,000 |
| $600,000 | $80,000 | 6% | $4,800 |
| $750,000 | $100,000 | 6% | $6,000 |

### Lifetime Impact
$50,000 offset on a $500,000 loan at 6% over 30 years:
- **Interest saved:** ~$106,000
- **Loan term reduced:** ~4 years

## Offset vs. Redraw

| Feature | Offset Account | Redraw Facility |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| Access | Instant, like normal account | May have delays/minimums |
| Account type | Separate transaction account | Part of your loan |
| Debit card | Usually yes | No |
| Tax treatment | Better for investment loans | Can be complicated |
| Fees | May have account fees | Usually free |

### Tax Consideration for Investors
Offset is preferred for investment loans. Using redraw can complicate tax deductibility of interest.

## Who Should Use an Offset Account?

### Ideal For
✅ Regular savers
✅ Emergency fund holders
✅ Business owners with variable income
✅ Property investors (tax reasons)
✅ Anyone with savings sitting in low-interest accounts

### Less Valuable If
❌ You have no savings
❌ You already maximise extra repayments
❌ The offset account has high fees
❌ You prefer the simplicity of redraw

## Offset Account Strategies

### Strategy 1: Emergency Fund Offset
Park your emergency fund (3-6 months expenses) in offset instead of a savings account. Same access, better returns.

**Example:**
Emergency fund: $30,000
Savings account interest: 4% = $1,200/year (taxable)
Offset benefit: 6% = $1,800/year (tax-free)
**Better off by:** $600+ per year

### Strategy 2: Income Parking
Have your salary paid into your offset account. Money sits there earning "interest" until you need it.

### Strategy 3: Business Float
Self-employed? Keep your business float in a personal offset account linked to your home loan.

### Strategy 4: Multiple Offset Accounts
Some loans allow multiple offsets. Use them for different savings goals:
- Offset 1: Emergency fund
- Offset 2: Holiday savings
- Offset 3: Car fund

All balances reduce your interest.

## Offset Account Fees

Some lenders charge for offset accounts:
- Monthly fee: $0 - $15
- Annual package fee: $0 - $400

**Calculate if it's worth it:**
$10/month fee = $120/year
You need ~$2,000 offset balance at 6% to break even
Anything above $2,000 = net benefit

## Finding Loans with Good Offset

Look for:
✅ 100% offset (not partial)
✅ No monthly offset account fee
✅ Multiple offset accounts available
✅ Debit card and online banking
✅ No minimum balance requirements

## Offset Account Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Choosing Partial Offset
Always check if it's 100% offset.

### Mistake 2: Ignoring Fees
High fees can wipe out offset benefits.

### Mistake 3: Keeping Savings Elsewhere
Money in other savings accounts isn't working as hard.

### Mistake 4: Not Using It
An empty offset account provides no benefit.

### Mistake 5: Wrong Structure for Investment
Using redraw on investment loans can create tax issues.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is money in an offset account safe?
Yes. It's just a regular transaction account. Your money isn't "in" your loan.

### Can I withdraw from my offset anytime?
Yes. It works like a normal transaction account with full access.

### Is offset better than making extra repayments?
Similar effect, but offset keeps funds accessible. Extra repayments may have redraw restrictions.

### Do I pay tax on offset "interest"?
No. You're not earning interest – you're paying less interest. No tax implications.

### Can I have an offset with a fixed rate loan?
Rarely. Most offset accounts are only available with variable rate loans.

### Is there a maximum offset balance?
Technically, your loan amount. Beyond that, excess funds don't provide additional benefit.
