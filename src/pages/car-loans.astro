    question: 'What interest rates can I get on a car loan?',
    answer: 'Car loan interest rates through NIK Finance start from 4.5% p.a. for well-qualified borrowers. Your actual rate depends on factors including your credit score, loan amount, vehicle age, and whether the loan is secured or unsecured. Our AI matching technology compares rates from over 130 lenders to find the most competitive option for your situation.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I get a car loan with bad credit?',
    answer: 'Yes. NIK Finance works with specialist lenders who offer car finance for applicants with impaired credit histories, defaults, or past bankruptcies. While rates may be higher than standard products, our panel includes lenders focused on second-chance lending. We assess each application individually and match you with lenders most likely to approve your profile.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How quickly can my car loan be approved?',
    answer: 'Many car loans are approved within 14 minutes when all documentation is provided upfront. Our AI-powered system matches your profile against lender criteria instantly, allowing your dedicated finance specialist to submit to the best-fit lender without delay. Settlement can occur within 24 to 48 hours for straightforward applications.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What documents do I need to apply for a car loan?',
    answer: 'Typically you will need proof of identity (driver licence or passport), proof of income (two recent payslips or tax returns for self-employed applicants), bank statements covering the last 90 days, and details of the vehicle you wish to purchase. If you are trading in a vehicle, you will also need its registration details and payout figure if financed.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I refinance my existing car loan?',
    answer: 'Absolutely. If your current car loan has a high interest rate or unfavourable terms, refinancing through NIK Finance could reduce your repayments significantly. We compare your existing loan against offers from 130+ lenders and handle the entire switch for you at no cost. Visit our refinancing page to learn more.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the maximum amount I can borrow for a car loan?',
    answer: 'Car loan amounts through our lender panel range from $5,000 to $500,000 depending on the lender and your borrowing capacity. Loan terms are available from 1 to 7 years. Higher loan amounts typically require a stronger credit profile and may need additional supporting documentation such as asset and liability statements.',
