## What is a Guarantor Home Loan?

A guarantor home loan allows a family member to use their property as additional security for your loan. This can help you buy with a smaller deposit and avoid Lenders Mortgage Insurance (LMI).

## How Does a Guarantor Loan Work?

### The Setup
1. You apply for a home loan
2. A family member (guarantor) offers their property as additional security
3. The lender has security over BOTH properties
4. You can borrow up to 100%+ of your property's value

### Security Structure
- **Your property:** Primary security
- **Guarantor's property:** Additional security (limited guarantee)

### The Guarantee Amount
Most guarantor loans use a "limited guarantee" – the guarantor is only liable for a specific amount (usually the portion above 80% LVR).

**Example:**
- Property: $600,000
- Your deposit: $30,000 (5%)
- Loan needed: $570,000 (95% LVR)
- 80% of property: $480,000
- Guarantee amount: $90,000 (the amount above 80%)

The guarantor is only guaranteeing $90,000, not the full loan.

## Benefits of Guarantor Loans

### 1. Minimal Deposit Required
Buy with as little as 0-5% deposit.

### 2. Avoid LMI
No LMI required even with less than 20% deposit. LMI savings: $15,000 - $40,000+

### 3. Get Into Market Sooner
Stop renting and start building equity years earlier.

### 4. Borrow More
May qualify for a higher loan amount with guarantor support.

### 5. Competitive Rates
Same rates as standard loans – no premium for guarantor structure.

## Who Can Be a Guarantor?

### Typical Requirements
- ✅ Immediate family (parents, siblings, sometimes grandparents)
- ✅ Property owner (sufficient equity)
- ✅ Financially stable
- ✅ Willing to provide independent legal advice certificate

### Who Usually CAN'T Be a Guarantor
- ❌ Friends
- ❌ Extended family (cousins, aunts, uncles – some exceptions)
- ❌ Business partners

## Risks for Guarantors

### The Main Risk
If you default AND your property sells for less than the debt, the lender can claim against the guarantor's property.

### Mitigating Factors

## How to Release a Guarantor

The guarantee doesn't last forever. Release typically happens when:

### 1. Equity Builds
Once your LVR drops below 80% (through repayments + growth), the guarantee can be released.

**Timeline:** Often 2-5 years, depending on market growth and extra repayments.

### 2. Refinance
Refinance to a standalone loan without the guarantee.

### 3. Property Revaluation
Request revaluation – if your property has increased in value, you may qualify for release.

Similar to guarantor, structured differently.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does the guarantor need to live in Australia?
Usually yes. Some lenders accept overseas guarantors with Australian property.

### Can my parents be guarantors if they still have a mortgage?
Yes, if they have sufficient equity. Typically need 80% LVR or better on their property.

### What if my guarantor wants to sell their property?
The guarantee must be released first (paid down to 80% LVR) or refinanced.

### Can I have multiple guarantors?
Some lenders allow it, but it's uncommon and adds complexity.

### Does being a guarantor affect their borrowing capacity?
Yes. The guarantee counts as a liability when they apply for credit.

### What if I miss a payment?
Communication is key. One missed payment won't trigger guarantor action, but chronic default eventually could.

### Can I use a guarantor for an investment property?
Some lenders allow it, but it's less common. Usually reserved for owner-occupied purchases.
