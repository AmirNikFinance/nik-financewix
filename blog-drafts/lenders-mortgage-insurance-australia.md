## What is Lenders Mortgage Insurance (LMI)?

Lenders Mortgage Insurance protects the **lender** (not you) if you default on your mortgage and the property sale doesn't cover the debt. It's a one-off premium charged when your deposit is less than 20%.

## Key Point: LMI Protects the Lender

Despite you paying for it, LMI doesn't protect you – it protects the bank. If you default and the property sells for less than the debt, the insurer pays the bank. They can still pursue you for the shortfall.

## Who Pays LMI?

**You do.** The premium is typically added to your loan (capitalised) or paid upfront at settlement.

## How Much Does LMI Cost?

LMI costs vary based on:
- Loan amount
- Loan-to-Value Ratio (LVR)
- Lender/insurer

### LMI Cost Examples

| Property Price | Deposit | LVR | Approximate LMI |
|---------------|---------|-----|-----------------|
| $600,000 | 5% ($30k) | 95% | $25,000 - $32,000 |
| $600,000 | 10% ($60k) | 90% | $12,000 - $16,000 |
| $600,000 | 15% ($90k) | 85% | $5,500 - $8,000 |
| $800,000 | 5% ($40k) | 95% | $38,000 - $48,000 |
| $800,000 | 10% ($80k) | 90% | $18,000 - $24,000 |
| $800,000 | 15% ($120k) | 85% | $8,000 - $12,000 |

*Costs are indicative and vary by lender and insurer.*

### LMI Scale
LMI increases exponentially as LVR increases:
- 85% LVR: Moderate LMI
- 90% LVR: Significant LMI
- 95% LVR: Very high LMI

## How to Avoid LMI

### 1. Save a 20% Deposit
The traditional way. No LMI required at 80% LVR or below.

### 2. First Home Guarantee (5% Deposit)
Government guarantees 15% of your loan. No LMI with just 5% deposit.

**Eligibility:**
- Australian citizen
- First home buyer
- Income caps apply
- Property price caps apply

### 3. Family Guarantee
Family member uses their property as additional security. Allows 0-20% deposit without LMI.

### 4. Professional Packages
Some lenders waive LMI for certain professionals:
- Medical doctors
- Lawyers
- Accountants
- Engineers
- Certain other professions

Typically allows up to 90% LVR without LMI.

### 5. Smaller Loan Amount
If LMI is pushing you over budget, consider a less expensive property to achieve 20% deposit.

## Is Paying LMI Worth It?

### Arguments FOR Paying LMI
✅ Get into the market sooner
✅ Property growth may exceed LMI cost
✅ Avoid years of extra saving
✅ Lock in current prices
✅ Stop paying rent

### Arguments AGAINST
❌ Large upfront cost
❌ Protects lender, not you
❌ Added to loan = pay interest on LMI
❌ May strain budget

### The Math
**Scenario:** Pay $15,000 LMI to buy now vs. save 2 more years

If property grows 5% annually on $600,000:
- Year 1: $30,000 growth
- Year 2: $31,500 growth
- Total growth: $61,500

$15,000 LMI vs. missing $61,500 growth = LMI may be worth it

*Note: Property doesn't always grow. This is not advice.*

## LMI on Investment Properties

LMI applies to investment properties too, though:
- Some lenders don't offer high LVR investor loans
- LMI costs may be slightly higher
- Tax treatment differs (LMI may be deductible)

## Is LMI Tax Deductible?

### Owner-Occupied
No. LMI is not tax deductible for your home.

### Investment Property
LMI can be claimed as a borrowing cost, deducted over 5 years or the loan term (whichever is shorter).

## LMI Refunds

If you pay out your loan within 2-3 years, you may be entitled to a partial LMI refund. Check with your lender – policies vary.

## LMI Premium Factors

LMI insurers consider:
- **Loan amount:** Higher loan = higher premium
- **LVR:** Higher LVR = much higher premium
- **Property type:** Houses vs. apartments vs. rural
- **Loan purpose:** Owner-occupied vs. investment
- **Location:** Some postcodes have restrictions
- **Borrower type:** PAYG vs. self-employed

## LMI Providers in Australia

Major LMI insurers:
- **Genworth** (now known as Helia)
- **QBE LMI**
- **Arch LMI** (newer entrant)

Your lender chooses the insurer – you don't get to pick.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I pay LMI upfront instead of adding to loan?
Yes, most lenders allow upfront payment. This avoids paying interest on the LMI amount.

### Is LMI a one-time payment?
Yes. You pay once at loan settlement. It covers the life of the loan.

### Do I need LMI if I refinance?
Potentially. If your new loan's LVR exceeds 80%, LMI may apply. However, if you've built equity, you may avoid it.

### Can I negotiate LMI?
Not directly, but different lenders use different insurers with different premiums. A broker can identify cheaper options.

### What if I want to access equity later?
If increasing your loan pushes LVR above 80%, additional LMI may apply.

### Does LMI transfer if I sell and buy?
No. LMI is property-specific. New purchase requires new assessment.
