## What is a Construction Loan?

A construction loan finances the building of a new home. Unlike a standard home loan (paid in full at settlement), a construction loan is drawn down in stages as building progresses.

## How Construction Loans Work

### Progress Payments
Money is released to your builder at key construction stages:

| Stage | Typical % | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Deposit | 5% | Initial payment to secure builder |
| Slab/Base | 10-15% | Foundation complete |
| Frame | 15-20% | Structural frame erected |
| Lock-up | 20-25% | External walls, roof, windows |
| Fixing | 15-20% | Internal walls, plumbing, electrical |
| Completion | 10-15% | Final finishes, handover |

### Interest During Construction
You only pay interest on funds drawn. As each stage completes and is paid, your interest costs increase.

**Example:**
- Month 1-2: Interest on $30,000 (deposit)
- Month 3-4: Interest on $80,000 (deposit + slab)
- Month 5-6: Interest on $160,000 (+ frame)
- And so on...

## Types of Construction Loans

### 1. House and Land Package
Builder and land sold together. Simpler process with predetermined costs.

### 2. Separate Land + Construction
Buy land first, then arrange construction. More flexibility but more complex.

### 3. Knockdown Rebuild
Demolish existing home and build new. Construction loan covers demolition and building.

### 4. Owner-Builder Loan
You manage the build yourself. More difficult to obtain – lenders see higher risk.

## Construction Loan Requirements

### Documentation
- ✅ Fixed price building contract
- ✅ Council-approved plans
- ✅ Builder's registration and insurance
- ✅ Specifications and inclusions list
- ✅ Soil/engineering reports
- ✅ Land title (or contract of sale)
- ✅ Standard income/ID documents

### Builder Requirements
Lenders require:
- Registered builder
- Current insurance (warranty, public liability)
- Fixed price contract (not cost-plus)
- Reasonable construction timeline

### Your Requirements
- 10-20% deposit (of total project cost)
- Sufficient income to service the loan
- Satisfactory credit history

## Construction Loan Rates

Construction loans typically have the same rates as standard home loans. However:
- **Interest-only during construction** – Common and practical
- **Variable rates** – Most construction loans are variable
- **Rate lock options** – Some lenders offer fixed rate construction loans

## Building Costs in Australia (2026)

| Build Type | Cost per m² |
|------------|-------------|
| Basic project home | $1,500 - $2,000 |
| Standard build | $2,000 - $2,500 |
| Custom home | $2,500 - $3,500 |
| Architecturally designed | $3,500 - $5,000+ |

**Example:** 200m² home at $2,500/m² = $500,000 build cost

Add land cost for total project budget.

## Progress Payment Process

### How Draws Work
1. Builder completes a stage
2. Builder invoices for that stage
3. You (or broker) request draw from lender
4. Lender arranges valuation/inspection
5. Funds released to builder
6. Interest charged on drawn amount

### Inspections
Lenders typically require inspection before releasing:
- Slab/Base stage
- Frame stage
- Completion stage

Some lenders inspect every stage.

## Fixed Price vs. Cost-Plus Contracts

### Fixed Price Contract ✅
Total price agreed upfront. Variations only for changes you request.

**Pros:** Budget certainty, easier to finance
**Cons:** Less flexibility, builder may cut corners

### Cost-Plus Contract ❌
You pay actual costs plus builder's margin. Final cost unknown.

**Pros:** Transparency, flexibility
**Cons:** Budget blowouts, harder to finance

**Most lenders require fixed price contracts.**

## Construction Loan Pitfalls

### 1. Budget Blowouts
Allow 10-15% contingency for unexpected costs.

### 2. Builder Delays
Delays extend interest-only period, costing more.

### 3. Variations
Changes during build add costs. Stick to plan if possible.

### 4. Valuation Shortfall
If bank values lower than contract, you need more deposit.

### 5. Builder Insolvency
Ensure builder has Home Warranty Insurance.

## Land Purchase + Construction

### Option 1: Separate Loans
- Land loan (settles when buying land)
- Construction loan (starts when building)

### Option 2: Combined Loan
- One loan covering land + construction
- Land portion settles first
- Construction draws follow

## House and Land Packages

### Advantages
✅ One contract, simpler process
✅ Known total cost
✅ Display homes to view
✅ Often includes standard inclusions

### Considerations
⚠️ Less customisation
⚠️ May be in new estates (limited amenities initially)
⚠️ Ensure quality isn't sacrificed

## Owner-Builder Loans

Building yourself? Expect:
- Higher deposit requirements (30-40%)
- Limited lender options
- Close scrutiny of qualifications/experience
- Potentially higher rates

Owner-builder loans are specialist products – not all lenders offer them.

## Tips for Construction Loan Success

1. **Get detailed quotes** – Compare builders thoroughly
2. **Review contract carefully** – Understand inclusions and exclusions
3. **Check builder reputation** – Reviews, references, completed projects
4. **Allow contingency** – 10-15% buffer for unexpected costs
5. **Understand timeline** – Realistic expectations reduce stress
6. **Communicate with lender** – Keep them informed of progress
7. **Inspect regularly** – Be involved in your build

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much deposit do I need for a construction loan?
Typically 10-20% of the total project cost (land + building).

### Can I get a construction loan with less than 20% deposit?
Yes, but LMI applies. First Home Guarantee may also be used.

### What if my builder goes bankrupt during construction?
Home Warranty Insurance covers incomplete work. Ensure your builder has current coverage.

### Can I make extra repayments during construction?
During the interest-only construction phase, extra payments may not reduce interest. Ask your lender.

### How long does construction finance approval take?
Allow 2-4 weeks. Have all documentation ready to speed the process.

### Can I live in the property during construction?
No. It's a construction site. You can move in after practical completion.
