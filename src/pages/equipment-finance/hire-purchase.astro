          <h2 class="font-montserrat font-bold text-2xl md:text-3xl text-[#1e3a5f] mb-6">What Is a Hire Purchase?</h2>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">A hire purchase (sometimes called a commercial hire purchase or CHP) is a business finance arrangement where the finance company purchases the asset on your behalf and hires it to you over an agreed term. You have full use of the asset from day one, make regular instalments (plus interest), and ownership transfers to you once all payments — including any residual or balloon — are made.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">Hire purchase is one of the core business finance structures in Australia, alongside chattel mortgage and finance lease. It is available exclusively to ABN holders and is designed for assets used primarily for business purposes. The structure has been a staple of Australian commercial lending for decades and is well understood by accountants, lenders, and the ATO.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">The key distinction from a chattel mortgage is the GST treatment. With a hire purchase, you do not own the asset during the term (the finance company does), so GST is included in each instalment and claimed progressively in each BAS period. With a chattel mortgage, you own the asset immediately and claim all GST upfront. This difference makes hire purchase attractive for businesses that prefer not to manage a large upfront GST credit.</p>

          <h2 class="font-montserrat font-bold text-2xl md:text-3xl text-[#1e3a5f] mb-6">Hire Purchase vs Chattel Mortgage</h2>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">Both structures offer similar tax benefits — interest deductions and depreciation claims. The main differences are:</p>

              <ul class="space-y-2 text-sm text-gray-600 font-lato font-light">
                <li>• You own asset from day one</li>
                <li>• Full GST claimed upfront in one BAS</li>
                <li>• Lender holds security interest (mortgage)</li>
                <li>• Better for maximising immediate GST refund</li>

              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">In practice, the total cost of each structure is very similar. The choice often comes down to GST cash flow preferences and accounting treatment. Your accountant can advise which is better for your specific situation. Nik Finance can arrange either structure from our panel of 130+ lenders.</p>

          <h2 class="font-montserrat font-bold text-2xl md:text-3xl text-[#1e3a5f] mb-6">Who Should Choose Hire Purchase?</h2>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">Hire purchase is a good fit for businesses that prefer to spread GST payments over the finance term rather than claiming a large refund upfront, businesses with accounting or reporting requirements that favour the hire purchase treatment, businesses that want the certainty of ownership at the end of the term without a separate purchase transaction, and businesses financing assets where the distinction between hire purchase and chattel mortgage accounting treatment matters for their financial statements.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">For most small businesses and sole traders, the practical difference between a chattel mortgage and hire purchase is the GST timing. Both deliver similar overall tax outcomes. Nik Finance can model both options so you can compare the after-tax cost and cash flow impact of each.</p>
