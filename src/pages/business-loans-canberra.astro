Beyond government contracting, the ACT hosts a growing private sector anchored by the Australian National University's research commercialisation, Canberra's emerging space and cyber security industries, and a thriving professional services community. NIK Finance helps Canberra businesses, from government IT contractors in Civic needing working capital between contract payments, to professional services firms in Deakin acquiring premises, to tradespeople in Fyshwick investing in equipment. Our AI technology understands the unique cash flow patterns of government contractor businesses, where payment terms can extend to 30-60 days, and connects you with lenders who accommodate the invoice-to-payment cycle that defines much of Canberra's commercial activity."
