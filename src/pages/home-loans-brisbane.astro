  cityDescription="Brisbane's property market has experienced remarkable growth, fuelled by interstate migration, major infrastructure investment including Cross River Rail and the Brisbane Metro, and the legacy of the 2032 Olympic Games announcement. From the character homes of Paddington and New Farm to the new developments in Springfield and North Lakes, Brisbane offers diverse property options at price points well below Sydney and Melbourne. NIK Finance understands the QLD market's unique features, including the absence of stamp duty for first home buyers on properties under $700,000, the $30,000 First Home Owner Grant for new builds, and the growing demand in Brisbane's rapidly transforming suburban precincts."
