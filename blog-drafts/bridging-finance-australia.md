## What is Bridging Finance?

Bridging finance is a short-term loan that lets you buy a new property before selling your existing one. It "bridges" the gap between purchases, so you don't miss your dream home.

## How Bridging Finance Works

### The Scenario
1. You find your dream home
2. Your current home hasn't sold yet
3. You need funds to buy the new property
4. Bridging loan covers the gap

### The Structure
**Peak debt:** Your current mortgage + new purchase price
**End debt:** New mortgage only (after current home sells)

### Example
- Current home value: $800,000
- Current mortgage: $300,000
- New home price: $900,000
- Peak debt: $300,000 + $900,000 = $1,200,000
- After selling current home: ~$900,000 mortgage on new home

## Types of Bridging Loans

### 1. Closed Bridging
Your current property has already sold (unconditional) but hasn't settled yet.

**Lower risk = Lower rates**

### 2. Open Bridging
Your current property is on the market but not sold.

**Higher risk = Higher rates**
Most lenders require sale within 6-12 months.

## Bridging Finance Costs

### Interest Rates
Typically 0.5% - 1% higher than standard home loan rates during the bridging period.

### Interest Capitalisation
Interest is usually added to the loan (capitalised) rather than paid monthly. You pay it when your old property sells.

### Example Costs
**Scenario:** $1,200,000 peak debt for 3 months

Interest at 7%:
- Monthly interest: ~$7,000
- 3 months capitalised: ~$21,000

This is added to your debt until the sale settles.

## When Bridging Finance Makes Sense

### Good Reasons to Bridge
✅ Found your perfect home in a competitive market
✅ Current property will sell quickly (good market)
✅ Don't want to rent between homes
✅ Children in school (avoid moving twice)
✅ Strong financial position to handle risk

### When to Avoid Bridging
❌ Slow property market
❌ Your property may be hard to sell
❌ Tight financial position
❌ Significant renovation needed before selling
❌ Property unique or niche market

## The Risks of Bridging

### Risk 1: Property Doesn't Sell
If your property doesn't sell within the bridging period, you may need to:
- Extend (costly)
- Accept lower price
- Cover two mortgages

### Risk 2: Sells for Less Than Expected
If you get less than expected, you'll have a larger end mortgage.

### Risk 3: Interest Accumulation
Bridging interest adds up quickly. Longer bridge = higher costs.

### Risk 4: Property Market Downturn
If market drops, you could be caught with more debt than planned.

## Bridging vs. Alternatives

### Sell First, Then Buy
**Pros:** No bridging risk, clear budget
**Cons:** May miss out on properties, need temporary accommodation

### Buy Subject to Sale
**Pros:** No bridging needed
**Cons:** Vendors often reject these offers in competitive markets

### Rent Your Current Home Temporarily
**Pros:** Rental income covers some costs
**Cons:** Complexity, tenant issues, tax implications

### Bridging Finance
**Pros:** Buy what you want, when you want
**Cons:** Higher costs, sale pressure, risk

## Qualifying for Bridging Finance

### Lender Requirements
- Sufficient equity in current property
- Ability to service peak debt (temporarily)
- Sale strategy for current property
- Good credit history

### Documentation Needed
- Current property valuation
- Existing mortgage details
- New property contract
- Evidence of serviceability
- Sale history/comparable sales evidence

## Bridging Loan Tips

### 1. Price Your Current Home Realistically
Overpricing extends the bridge and costs more.

### 2. Have It Market-Ready
Don't buy the new place until old one is ready to list.

### 3. Consider the Market
Strong seller's market = safer bridging.

### 4. Budget for Worst Case
What if it takes 6 months to sell?

### 5. Get Pre-Approved
Know your bridging limit before making offers.

### 6. Work With Experienced Broker
Bridging requires coordination and expertise.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long can bridging finance last?
Typically 6-12 months. Some lenders allow extensions at additional cost.

### Can I make interest payments during bridging?
Usually optional. Most people capitalise interest to preserve cash flow.

### What if my property sells quickly?
Great! You exit bridging early. Interest stops accumulating.

### Do I need two loans?
It's usually structured as one combined loan with peak debt reducing when your property sells.

### Can I get bridging with bad credit?
Difficult. Bridging already carries higher risk; bad credit compounds this.

### Is bridging finance tax deductible?
Interest during bridging for investment properties may be deductible. Get tax advice.

## Is Bridging Right for You?

Consider bridging if:
✅ Your property will sell within 3-6 months
✅ You have significant equity
✅ Market conditions favour sellers
✅ You found an unmissable opportunity
✅ You can handle the financial risk

Avoid if:
❌ Uncertain about selling timeline
❌ Limited equity
