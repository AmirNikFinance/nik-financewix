## What is Debt Consolidation?

Debt consolidation combines multiple debts into a single loan with one repayment. Instead of juggling several payments at different rates, you have one manageable payment – often at a lower overall interest rate.

## How Debt Consolidation Works

### Before Consolidation
| Debt | Balance | Interest Rate | Monthly Payment |
|------|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| Credit Card 1 | $8,000 | 20% | $240 |
| Credit Card 2 | $5,000 | 18% | $150 |
| Car Loan | $12,000 | 14% | $320 |
| Personal Loan | $5,000 | 15% | $170 |
| **Total** | **$30,000** | **Various** | **$880** |

### After Consolidation
| Debt | Balance | Interest Rate | Monthly Payment |
|------|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| Consolidation Loan | $30,000 | 10% | $637 |

**Monthly savings: $243**
**Annual savings: $2,916**

## Debt Consolidation Options

### 1. Personal Loan
Unsecured loan to pay off all debts.

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| No security required | Higher rates than secured |
| Fixed repayments | May not cover all debts |
| Set end date | Credit check required |

**Best for:** Moderate debts ($5,000-$50,000)

### 2. Home Loan Refinance
Add debts to your mortgage (if you own property).

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Lowest interest rates | Puts home at risk |
| Maximum savings | Longer repayment = more interest |
| Large amounts possible | Not for non-homeowners |

**Best for:** Homeowners with significant debts

### 3. Secured Personal Loan
Loan secured against your car or other asset.

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Lower rates than unsecured | Asset at risk |
| Better approval odds | Need qualifying asset |

**Best for:** Those with a car but no property

### 4. Balance Transfer Credit Card
Transfer credit card debts to a 0% introductory rate card.

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| 0% interest period | Only for credit card debt |
| Can save significantly | High rate after intro period |
| Easy to set up | Balance transfer fee (1-3%) |

**Best for:** Credit card debt you can pay off in 12-24 months

## When Should You Consolidate?

### Consolidation Makes Sense If:
✅ You have multiple high-interest debts
✅ You're struggling to track payments
✅ You can get a lower overall interest rate
✅ You're committed to not accruing new debt
✅ Your financial situation is stable

### Consolidation May NOT Be Right If:
❌ You'll keep using credit cards
❌ You can't get a better rate
❌ Your debts are very small
❌ You're close to paying off existing debts
❌ You're considering bankruptcy

## The Risks of Consolidation

### Extended Loan Term
Lower payments often mean longer terms. You might pay more total interest over time.

**Example:**
- Original debts: $30,000 over 3 years @ various rates
- Consolidated: $30,000 over 7 years @ 10%
- Lower monthly payment BUT more total interest

**Solution:** Keep payments high, pay off faster.

### Securing Unsecured Debt
Adding credit card debt to your mortgage converts unsecured debt to secured debt. Your home is now at risk for what was originally credit card debt.

### Debt Cycling
Consolidating, then racking up credit cards again. Avoid this trap – consider closing cards after consolidation.

## How Much Can You Save?

### Scenario 1: Credit Card Debt
- **Before:** $20,000 on credit cards at 20% = $4,000/year interest
- **After:** $20,000 personal loan at 10% = $2,000/year interest
- **Savings:** $2,000/year

### Scenario 2: Multiple Debts to Mortgage
- **Before:** $50,000 across cards/loans at average 15% = $7,500/year
- **After:** $50,000 added to mortgage at 6% = $3,000/year
- **Savings:** $4,500/year

*Note: Mortgage term extension can offset savings. Pay extra to maintain benefit.*
