## Why Refinance Your Home Loan?

If you haven't reviewed your home loan in the last 2 years, you're probably paying too much. Refinancing could save you hundreds per month and tens of thousands over the life of your loan.

**Average savings for Nik Finance customers:**
- **Monthly savings:** $200-$500
- **Annual savings:** $2,400-$6,000
- **Lifetime savings:** $50,000-$150,000+

## What is Home Loan Refinancing?

Refinancing means replacing your current mortgage with a new one, typically with a different lender at a better rate. Your new lender pays out your old loan, and you start fresh with improved terms.

## Top Reasons to Refinance

### 1. Lower Interest Rate
The most common reason. Even a 0.5% rate reduction on a $500,000 loan saves ~$2,500 per year.

| Current Rate | New Rate | Loan Amount | Annual Savings |
|--------------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| 6.5% | 6.0% | $400,000 | $2,000 |
| 6.5% | 5.75% | $500,000 | $3,750 |
| 7.0% | 6.0% | $600,000 | $6,000 |
| 7.5% | 6.25% | $700,000 | $8,750 |

### 2. Access Equity
Your home may have increased in value. Refinancing lets you access this equity for:
- Home renovations
- Investment property deposit
- Debt consolidation
- Other major expenses

### 3. Consolidate Debts
Roll high-interest debts (credit cards, personal loans, car loans) into your mortgage at a much lower rate.

**Example:**
- Credit card debt: $20,000 at 20% = $4,000/year interest
- Consolidated into mortgage at 6% = $1,200/year interest
- **Annual savings: $2,800**

### 4. Change Loan Features
- Switch from variable to fixed (or vice versa)
- Add an offset account
- Get a redraw facility
- Split your loan

### 5. Remove a Borrower
After a divorce or separation, refinancing can remove an ex-partner from the loan.

### 6. Escape Your Current Lender
Poor service? Hidden fees? Refinancing lets you move to a better lender.

## How Much Could You Save?

**Refinancing Calculator Example:**

**Current loan:**
- Balance: $500,000
- Rate: 6.8%
- Monthly repayment: $3,262
- Remaining term: 25 years

**After refinancing at 6.0%:**
- Balance: $500,000
- Rate: 6.0%

- Remaining term: 25 years

## When Should You Refinance?

✅ **Refinance NOW if:**
- Your rate is 0.5%+ above current market rates
- You haven't refinanced in 2+ years
- Your LVR has improved (more equity)
- Your credit score has improved
- You have high-interest debts to consolidate
- You want better loan features

❌ **Wait or reconsider if:**
- You're planning to sell within 12 months
- Break costs exceed potential savings
- Your loan balance is very low
- Your credit situation has worsened significantly

## Refinancing Costs to Consider

| Cost Type | Typical Amount | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|-------|
| Discharge fee (old lender) | $150-$400 | Unavoidable |
| Break costs (fixed loans) | $0-$20,000+ | Can be significant |
| Application fee (new lender) | $0-$600 | Many lenders waive this |
| Valuation fee | $0-$500 | Often free with new lender |
| Settlement fee | $100-$300 | Legal/admin costs |
| Mortgage registration | ~$150 | Government fee |

**Most refinancers save more than the costs within 6-12 months.**

## Fixed vs. Variable: Which Should You Choose?

### Variable Rate
✅ Flexibility to make extra repayments
✅ Access to offset accounts and redraw
✅ No break costs if you sell or refinance
❌ Rate can increase

### Fixed Rate
✅ Payment certainty for 1-5 years
✅ Protection against rate rises
❌ Break costs if you exit early
❌ Limited extra repayment options

### Split Loan
Many borrowers choose a split loan:
- 50% fixed (for certainty)
- 50% variable (for flexibility)

## How to Refinance Your Home Loan

### Step 1: Review Your Current Loan
Find out your:
- Current interest rate
- Loan balance
- Remaining term
- Any exit fees or break costs

### Step 2: Check Your Property Value
Your Loan-to-Value Ratio (LVR) affects the rates you qualify for. Lower LVR = better rates.

### Step 3: Get a Refinance Quote
A broker compares 130+ lenders to find your best option. This takes minutes and is obligation-free.

### Step 4: Gather Your Documents
- Recent payslips (or tax returns if self-employed)
- Bank statements (3 months)
- Current mortgage statement
- Photo ID

### Step 5: Submit Your Application
Your broker handles the paperwork and liaises with lenders on your behalf.

### Step 6: Settlement
The new lender pays out your old loan. Typical timeframe: 2-4 weeks.

## Cash-Out Refinancing: Accessing Your Equity

If your property has increased in value, you can "cash out" equity when refinancing.

**Example:**
- Property value: $800,000
- Current loan: $400,000
- Available equity (80% LVR): $240,000

You could refinance to a $500,000 loan and receive $100,000 cash for renovations, investments, or other purposes.

## Refinancing with Different Loan Types

### Owner-Occupied Refinance
Standard refinancing for your primary residence. Best rates available.

### Investment Property Refinance
Slightly higher rates but still significant savings possible. Interest may be tax-deductible.

### Refinance to SMSF Loan
Complex but possible. Requires specialist advice.

### Construction Loan Refinance
Can refinance to a standard loan once construction is complete.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How often can I refinance?
As often as you like, but typically every 2-3 years makes sense to capture savings without excessive hassle.

### Will refinancing affect my credit score?
The credit inquiry causes a small, temporary dip. Consistent repayments on your new loan will maintain or improve your score.

### Can I refinance with bad credit?
Yes, though options may be limited and rates higher. Specialist lenders exist for this situation.

### Can I refinance if I'm self-employed?
Absolutely. You'll need tax returns (2 years) and possibly an accountant's letter instead of payslips.

### What's the minimum equity needed to refinance?
Most lenders require at least 20% equity (80% LVR) to avoid Lenders Mortgage Insurance. Some offer refinancing at higher LVRs.

### How long does refinancing take?
Typically 2-4 weeks from application to settlement. Some lenders offer faster turnarounds.
