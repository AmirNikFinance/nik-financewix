## What is a Novated Lease?

A novated lease is a three-way agreement between you, your employer, and a finance company. You lease a car, and your employer deducts payments from your pre-tax salary (salary sacrifice), potentially saving you thousands in tax.

## How Does a Novated Lease Work?

### The Three Parties
1. **You** – Choose the car and use it
2. **Your Employer** – Makes payments from your salary
3. **Finance Company** – Owns the car during the lease

### The Payment Structure
Your employer deducts two components from your salary:
- **Pre-tax:** Lease payments (reduces taxable income)
- **Post-tax:** Running costs (GST-free benefits)

### At Lease End
You can:
- Pay the residual and own the car
- Refinance the residual
- Trade in for a new novated lease
- Return the car (rare)

## Novated Lease Tax Benefits

### Income Tax Savings
Lease payments come from pre-tax salary, reducing your taxable income.

**Example:**
| Without Novated Lease | With Novated Lease |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| Salary: $100,000 | Salary: $100,000 |
| Tax on full amount | Tax on $88,000 |
| Pay car costs after tax | Car costs pre-tax |
| **More tax paid** | **Less tax paid** |

### GST Savings
Running costs (fuel, servicing, insurance) are effectively GST-free through the salary packaging arrangement.

### Potential Annual Savings
| Income Level | Annual Savings Range |
|--------------|---------------------|
| $60,000 | $2,000 - $4,000 |
| $80,000 | $3,000 - $5,500 |
| $100,000 | $4,000 - $7,000 |
| $120,000+ | $5,000 - $9,000+ |

*Savings depend on car, kilometres driven, and personal circumstances.*

## Fringe Benefits Tax (FBT)

Novated leases attract FBT, which your employer reports. However, the Employee Contribution Method (ECM) can reduce or eliminate FBT:

### ECM Explained
You contribute post-tax dollars toward running costs. This reduces the taxable value of the benefit, often to zero FBT.

### Electric Vehicles (EVs)
EVs under the luxury car threshold are FBT-exempt (until 2025, then reviewed). This makes EVs particularly attractive for novated leases.
