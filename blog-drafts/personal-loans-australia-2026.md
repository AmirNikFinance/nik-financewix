## What is a Personal Loan?

A personal loan is money borrowed from a lender that you repay in regular instalments over a set period. Unlike a credit card, personal loans have a fixed end date and typically offer lower interest rates.

## Types of Personal Loans

### Secured Personal Loan
Your loan is backed by an asset (car, savings, or term deposit) as security.

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Typical rates | 6.99% - 12% p.a. |
| Loan amounts | $5,000 - $100,000 |
| Terms | 1 - 7 years |
| Pros | Lower rates |
| Cons | Risk losing your asset |

### Unsecured Personal Loan
No collateral required. Approval based on your income and credit history.

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Typical rates | 8% - 20% p.a. |
| Loan amounts | $2,000 - $50,000 |
| Terms | 1 - 7 years |
| Pros | No asset at risk |
| Cons | Higher rates |

### Fixed Rate Personal Loan
Interest rate stays the same for the entire loan term.

**Pros:** Predictable repayments, protection against rate rises
**Cons:** May miss out if rates drop, early exit fees possible

### Variable Rate Personal Loan
Interest rate can change during the loan term.

**Pros:** May benefit from rate drops, usually more flexible
**Cons:** Payments can increase if rates rise

## Personal Loan Interest Rates (2026)

Rates vary significantly based on your credit profile:

| Credit Score | Typical Rate Range |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Excellent (800+) | 6.99% - 9.99% |
| Good (700-799) | 9.99% - 12.99% |
| Average (600-699) | 12.99% - 16.99% |
| Fair (500-599) | 16.99% - 22.99% |

## How to Get the Best Personal Loan Rate

### 1. Check Your Credit Score
Know your score before applying. This helps set realistic expectations and identify any errors to fix.

### 2. Compare Multiple Lenders
Don't accept the first offer. A broker can compare 130+ lenders in minutes.

### 3. Consider Secured Options
If you have an asset to secure the loan, you'll typically get a lower rate.

### 4. Borrow Only What You Need
Larger loans = more interest. Borrow the minimum required.

### 5. Choose the Shortest Affordable Term
Shorter terms mean higher repayments but less total interest.

### 6. Avoid Add-Ons
Payment protection insurance and other add-ons increase costs. Consider carefully before adding.

## Personal Loan vs. Other Options

| Option | Pros | Cons | Best For |
|--------|------|------|----------|
| Personal loan | Fixed repayments, set term | Higher rate than secured | Medium-term borrowing |
| Credit card | Flexible, interest-free period | High rates if not paid off | Short-term, small amounts |
| Home equity | Lowest rates | Puts home at risk | Large amounts, homeowners |
| Car loan | Lower rates (secured) | Car is security | Vehicle purchases |
| BNPL | No interest | Fees, spending risk | Small purchases |

## Debt Consolidation with Personal Loans

If you have multiple debts (credit cards, store cards, other loans), a debt consolidation personal loan can:

- **Simplify:** One payment instead of many
- **Save:** Lower interest rate than credit cards
- **Pay off faster:** Fixed end date

### Example Debt Consolidation

**Before:**
- Credit card 1: $8,000 @ 20% = $1,600/year interest
- Credit card 2: $5,000 @ 18% = $900/year interest
- Store card: $2,000 @ 25% = $500/year interest
- **Total: $15,000 debt, $3,000/year interest**

**After consolidation:**
- Personal loan: $15,000 @ 10% = $1,500/year interest
- **Savings: $1,500/year**

## Personal Loans for Bad Credit

Had credit issues? You still have options:

### Specialist Lenders
Some lenders focus on applicants with:
- Past defaults
- Low credit scores
- Previous bankruptcies
- Centrelink income

### How to Improve Your Chances
1. Be honest about your credit history
2. Show stable income
3. Reduce existing debts if possible
4. Consider a secured loan
5. Use a broker who knows the right lenders

### Expect Higher Rates
Bad credit loans typically range from 15-29% p.a. However, responsible repayment helps rebuild your credit score.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How quickly can I get a personal loan?
Same-day approval is possible with some lenders. Funds typically arrive 1-3 business days after approval.

### Can I pay off my personal loan early?
Most loans allow early repayment. Some have early exit fees (especially fixed-rate loans), so check your contract.

### Does applying for a personal loan affect my credit score?
Each application creates a "hard inquiry" which can temporarily lower your score. Multiple applications in a short period can be seen negatively. A broker can help minimise inquiries.

### Can I get a personal loan while on Centrelink?
Yes, some lenders accept Centrelink income. Options and amounts may be limited.

### What's the difference between comparison rate and interest rate?
The comparison rate includes fees and charges, giving a more accurate picture of the loan's true cost. Always compare using comparison rates.

### Can I get a personal loan with no credit history?
Limited credit history makes approval harder but not impossible. Some lenders specialise in "thin file" applicants.
