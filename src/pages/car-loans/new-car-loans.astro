        <h2 class="font-montserrat font-bold text-2xl md:text-3xl text-[#1e3a5f] mb-6">New Car Loan Rates in Australia (February 2026)</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">New car loan rates in early 2026 range from approximately 5.09% to 9.99% p.a. depending on your credit profile, the lender, and whether the loan is secured or unsecured. The lowest available rate is 5.09% from RACV for green/EV vehicles, and 5.49% for standard new cars. The RBA cash rate sits at 3.85% following the February increase.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">New cars consistently attract lower rates than used cars because they hold more value, come with manufacturer warranties, and represent lower risk to lenders. The average new car loan through broker channels is approximately 6.5–7.0% p.a. for borrowers with good credit. The average car loan amount in Australia is $33,489.</p>
        <div class="bg-[#0d4d3e]/5 border-l-4 border-[#10b981] rounded-r-lg p-6 my-6"><p class="text-[#0d4d3e] font-lato font-light leading-relaxed">Always compare the comparison rate, not just the advertised rate. The comparison rate includes certain fees and gives a truer picture of the total cost. For example, a loan advertised at 5.49% may have a comparison rate of 5.90% once establishment and monthly fees are included.</p></div>

        <h2 class="font-montserrat font-bold text-2xl md:text-3xl text-[#1e3a5f] mb-6">Secured vs Unsecured New Car Loans</h2>
        <h3 class="font-montserrat font-semibold text-xl text-[#0d4d3e] mt-8 mb-4">Secured (Recommended for Most Buyers)</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">The vehicle acts as collateral. If you default, the lender can repossess the car. In return, you get a lower interest rate (often 1–3% less than unsecured), higher borrowing limits (up to $100,000+ with some lenders), and longer terms. Most new car loans in Australia are secured.</p>
        <h3 class="font-montserrat font-semibold text-xl text-[#0d4d3e] mt-8 mb-4">Unsecured</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">No asset attached — the lender cannot repossess the vehicle. Higher rates due to increased lender risk. Useful if you are buying a vehicle that does not meet secured lending criteria or if you want the flexibility to sell without lender consent. The lowest unsecured rate currently available is 5.66% from Harmoney.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">Getting pre-approved before you visit a dealership gives you a confirmed budget, a benchmark interest rate to compare against dealer finance, and negotiating power — the dealer knows you can settle immediately.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">Nik Finance provides pre-approval from our 130+ lender panel with an initial soft credit check. Once you have chosen a vehicle, we convert to formal approval (usually 24–48 hours). This single-application approach minimises credit enquiries on your file.</p>
        <div class="bg-[#0d4d3e]/5 border-l-4 border-[#10b981] rounded-r-lg p-6 my-6"><p class="text-[#0d4d3e] font-lato font-light leading-relaxed">Pro tip: get pre-approved through a broker, then ask the dealer if they can beat your rate. If they can, use their finance. If not, you already have approval ready. Either way, you get the best deal.</p></div>

        <h2 class="font-montserrat font-bold text-2xl md:text-3xl text-[#1e3a5f] mb-6">Top-Selling New Cars in Australia (January 2026)</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">The most popular new vehicles in January 2026 were the Ford Ranger, Toyota HiLux, Mazda CX-5, and Chery Tiggo 4 Pro. Toyota, Mazda, Kia, Ford, and Hyundai were the top-selling brands. Total new vehicle sales were 87,092 units, up 0.3% year-on-year.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">Petrol vehicle sales fell 14% as buyers shifted to electrified options. Plug-in hybrid sales surged 170.5% year-on-year. This trend is relevant for finance because many lenders now offer discounted green car loan rates for EVs and PHEVs.</p>
