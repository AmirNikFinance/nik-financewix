  <script type="application/ld+json" set:html={`{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage","mainEntity":[{"@type":"Question","name":"What is the difference between a chattel mortgage and hire purchase?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"With a chattel mortgage, you own the equipment from day one and the lender holds a security interest. You claim GST upfront and deduct interest and depreciation. With hire purchase, the finance company owns the equipment during the term and you gain ownership at the end. GST is claimed on each instalment rather than upfront. Both allow you to claim interest and depreciation. The best choice depends on your GST registration status and cash flow preferences — your accountant can advise on which is more tax-effective for your situation."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I finance used or second-hand equipment?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes. Most lenders finance both new and used equipment, though rates for used equipment are typically slightly higher. The key factors are the age of the equipment (most lenders have maximum age limits — for example, a maximum of 10–15 years old at end of loan term), whether it has strong resale value, and the condition. A professional valuation or dealer invoice is usually required for used equipment over a certain value."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How much deposit do I need for equipment finance?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Many equipment finance products require no deposit at all — particularly chattel mortgage and hire purchase for borrowers with strong credit profiles. Some lenders offer 100% financing plus on-road costs for vehicles. However, having a deposit of 10–20% can improve your rate and increase the chances of approval for newer businesses or borrowers with impaired credit. For soft assets (equipment without strong resale value), a deposit is more commonly required."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What is a balloon payment or residual value?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"A balloon or residual is a lump sum payment due at the end of your finance term. Setting a residual reduces your regular monthly repayments during the loan term, improving cash flow. At the end, you pay the residual to take full ownership, refinance the residual amount, trade the equipment in, or return it (lease structures only). Residual values typically range from 10–40% of the purchase price depending on the structure and equipment type."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How long does equipment finance approval take?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"For straightforward applications under $250,000 with a strong credit profile, many lenders provide same-day or next-day conditional approval. Larger amounts or more complex applications typically take 2–5 business days. Through Nik Finance, we submit your application to lenders best suited to your profile, which speeds up the process. Settlement typically occurs within 1–2 weeks of approval."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I get equipment finance with bad credit?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes. While the best rates are reserved for borrowers with clean credit, there are specialist lenders who provide equipment finance for businesses with impaired credit — including paid defaults, discharged bankruptcies, and other credit events. Rates will be higher (typically 10–18% p.a.) and a deposit may be required. Having strong current business cash flow and the equipment as security works in your favour."}}]}`} />

          <h2 class="font-montserrat font-bold text-2xl md:text-3xl text-[#1e3a5f] mb-6">What Is Equipment Finance?</h2>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">Equipment finance is a broad category of commercial lending that helps Australian businesses acquire the tools, machinery, vehicles, technology, and other physical assets they need to operate and grow — without paying the full cost upfront. Instead of tying up working capital in a large purchase, you spread the cost over the useful life of the equipment through regular repayments.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">In Australia, equipment finance is one of the most commonly used forms of business lending. The Australian Finance Industry Association (AFIA) reports that over $50 billion in new equipment and vehicle finance is written annually. From a single tradesperson buying a work ute to a construction company acquiring a fleet of excavators, equipment finance makes business growth accessible without depleting cash reserves.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">The Australian government supports equipment investment through the instant asset write-off scheme (currently allowing businesses with aggregated turnover under $10 million to immediately deduct the full cost of eligible assets up to $20,000 per asset) and other depreciation provisions. Your finance structure determines how these tax benefits are claimed — which is why choosing the right structure matters as much as choosing the right lender.</p>

          <h2 class="font-montserrat font-bold text-2xl md:text-3xl text-[#1e3a5f] mb-6">Equipment Finance Structures Explained</h2>

          <h3 class="font-montserrat font-semibold text-xl text-[#0d4d3e] mt-8 mb-4">Chattel Mortgage</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">You own the equipment from day one. The lender holds a mortgage (security interest) over the asset. You claim GST upfront, deduct interest and depreciation. Best for GST-registered businesses wanting maximum tax benefits. This is the most popular structure for vehicle and equipment purchases in Australia.</p>

          <h3 class="font-montserrat font-semibold text-xl text-[#0d4d3e] mt-8 mb-4">Hire Purchase</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">The finance company purchases the equipment and hires it to you. You gain ownership at the end of the term after making all payments (including any residual). You can claim interest and depreciation. GST is payable on each instalment rather than upfront. Good for businesses that prefer to spread their GST liability.</p>

          <h3 class="font-montserrat font-semibold text-xl text-[#0d4d3e] mt-8 mb-4">Finance Lease</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">The lender owns the equipment and leases it to you for a fixed term. You may have the option to purchase at the end for a residual value, return the equipment, or re-lease. Lease payments are generally fully tax-deductible as an operating expense. Equipment does not appear as an asset on your balance sheet (off-balance-sheet financing), which can be advantageous for certain businesses.</p>

          <h3 class="font-montserrat font-semibold text-xl text-[#0d4d3e] mt-8 mb-4">Operating Lease / Rental</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">Similar to a finance lease but typically shorter term, with the equipment returned at the end. Best for technology and equipment that becomes obsolete quickly — you upgrade rather than own. All payments are fully deductible. No residual risk. Popular for IT equipment, medical technology, and fleet vehicles where staying current matters more than ownership.</p>

          <div class="bg-[#0d4d3e]/5 border-l-4 border-[#10b981] rounded-r-lg p-6 my-6">
            <p class="text-[#0d4d3e] font-lato font-light leading-relaxed"><strong>Which structure is best for you?</strong> It depends on your business structure, GST registration status, cash flow preferences, and how you want to claim tax deductions. Nik Finance helps you compare not just rates but structures — so you choose the option that delivers the best overall outcome for your business. We always recommend consulting your accountant before committing to a finance structure.</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed">With a chattel mortgage, you own the equipment from day one and the lender holds a security interest. You claim GST upfront and deduct interest and depreciation. With hire purchase, the finance company owns the equipment during the term and you gain ownership at the end. GST is claimed on each instalment rather than upfront. Both allow you to claim interest and depreciation. The best choice depends on your GST registration status and cash flow preferences — your accountant can advise on which is more tax-effective for your situation.</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed">Yes. Most lenders finance both new and used equipment, though rates for used equipment are typically slightly higher. The key factors are the age of the equipment (most lenders have maximum age limits — for example, a maximum of 10–15 years old at end of loan term), whether it has strong resale value, and the condition. A professional valuation or dealer invoice is usually required for used equipment over a certain value.</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed">Many equipment finance products require no deposit at all — particularly chattel mortgage and hire purchase for borrowers with strong credit profiles. Some lenders offer 100% financing plus on-road costs for vehicles. However, having a deposit of 10–20% can improve your rate and increase the chances of approval for newer businesses or borrowers with impaired credit. For soft assets (equipment without strong resale value), a deposit is more commonly required.</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed">A balloon or residual is a lump sum payment due at the end of your finance term. Setting a residual reduces your regular monthly repayments during the loan term, improving cash flow. At the end, you pay the residual to take full ownership, refinance the residual amount, trade the equipment in, or return it (lease structures only). Residual values typically range from 10–40% of the purchase price depending on the structure and equipment type.</p>

While the best rates are reserved for borrowers with clean credit, there are specialist lenders who provide equipment finance for businesses with impaired credit — including paid defaults, discharged bankruptcies, and other credit events. Rates will be higher (typically 10–18% p.a.) and a deposit may be required. Having strong current business cash flow and the equipment as security works in your favour.</p>
