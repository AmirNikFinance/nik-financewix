4. **Use a broker** - We know which lenders approve fastest
5. **Apply during business hours** - Faster processing

**Fastest options:**
- Unsecured loans: Same-day approval possible
- Line of credit: 24-48 hours
- Equipment finance: 1-3 days

## Business Loan for Bad Credit

Had credit issues? Options still exist:

- Current cash flow (not just historical credit)
- Security available
- Time since credit issues

### Tips for Approval
- Be upfront about your credit history
- Show strong recent revenue
- Provide security if possible
- Use a specialist broker (we know the right lenders)

## Tax Benefits of Business Loans

### Interest Deductibility
Interest on business loans is typically tax-deductible as a business expense.

### Instant Asset Write-Off
For equipment finance, you may be able to immediately deduct the full cost of assets up to relevant thresholds.

### Depreciation
Spread the tax benefit of equipment purchases over multiple years.

**Always consult your accountant for specific tax advice.**

## Business Loan vs. Personal Loan

| Factor | Business Loan | Personal Loan |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| Tax deductible | Yes | No (unless for business) |
| Amounts available | Higher | Limited |
| Documentation | More complex | Simpler |
| Rates | Often lower | Higher |
| Personal liability | May be limited | Full |

**Recommendation:** Keep business and personal finances separate for tax purposes and liability protection.
