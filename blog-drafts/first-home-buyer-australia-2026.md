## First Home Guarantee (5% Deposit Scheme)

The Federal Government's First Home Guarantee allows eligible buyers to purchase with just a 5% deposit, without paying Lenders Mortgage Insurance (LMI).

### How It Works
- Government guarantees the remaining 15% of the deposit
- You avoid LMI (saving $10,000-$30,000+)
- Limited places available each financial year

### Eligibility Criteria
- ✅ Australian citizen (permanent residents not eligible)
- ✅ At least 18 years old
- ✅ First home buyer (never owned property in Australia)
- ✅ Income cap: $125,000 (singles) / $200,000 (couples)
- ✅ Intend to live in the property as your home

### Property Price Caps (2026)

| Location | Price Cap |
|----------|-----------|
| Sydney | $900,000 |
| Melbourne | $800,000 |
| Brisbane | $700,000 |
| Perth | $600,000 |
| Adelaide | $600,000 |
| Other capitals | Varies |
| Regional areas | Varies (often lower) |

## Regional First Home Buyer Guarantee

If you're buying in a regional area, there's a separate scheme with 10,000 places annually. This helps first home buyers purchase in regional Australia.

## Family Home Guarantee (Single Parents)

Single parents (including those who have previously owned property) can access the Family Home Guarantee with just a 2% deposit.

### Eligibility
- Single parent with at least one dependent child
- Taxable income up to $125,000
- Australian citizen
- Must live in the property

## Help to Buy Scheme (Coming Soon)

The Federal Government's Help to Buy scheme will allow eligible buyers to purchase with a government equity contribution of up to 40% (new homes) or 30% (existing homes).

**Key features:**
- Minimum 2% deposit required
- Government co-owns the property
- Lower mortgage repayments
- Buy back the government share over time

## First Home Super Saver Scheme (FHSSS)

The FHSSS allows you to save for your first home deposit inside your superannuation, with tax benefits.

### How It Works
1. Make voluntary contributions to your super (up to $15,000/year)
2. Maximum total contributions: $50,000
3. Withdraw contributions + deemed earnings for your deposit
4. Save on tax (contributions taxed at 15% instead of your marginal rate)

### Example Savings
If you earn $80,000 and contribute $15,000 to super:
- Tax saved: ~$4,500 (vs. saving in a regular account)
- Over 3 years: ~$13,500 in tax savings

## How Much Deposit Do I Need?

| Deposit Type | Amount | LMI Required? |
|--------------|--------|---------------|
| Standard | 20% | No |
| Low deposit | 10-20% | Yes (unless guarantor) |
| First Home Guarantee | 5% | No (government guarantee) |
| Family Home Guarantee | 2% | No (single parents) |
| Guarantor loan | 0-5% | No (family guarantee) |

### LMI Costs (If Required)
LMI protects the lender if you default. It can cost $10,000-$30,000+ depending on your loan size and deposit.

**Example LMI costs on a $600,000 property:**
- 10% deposit: ~$12,000-$15,000
- 5% deposit: ~$20,000-$25,000

The First Home Guarantee helps you avoid this cost entirely.

## What Income Do I Need?

Your borrowing capacity depends on income, expenses, and existing debts. As a rough guide:

| Combined Income | Approximate Borrowing Capacity |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| $80,000 | $400,000 - $500,000 |
| $100,000 | $500,000 - $650,000 |
| $120,000 | $600,000 - $780,000 |
| $150,000 | $750,000 - $950,000 |
| $200,000 | $1,000,000+ |

*These are estimates. Actual capacity varies based on your complete financial situation.*

## Steps to Buying Your First Home

### Step 1: Check Your Eligibility
Confirm you qualify for first home buyer grants and schemes in your state.

### Step 2: Get Pre-Approved
Pre-approval tells you exactly how much you can borrow. This takes 1-3 days and gives you confidence when house hunting.

### Step 3: Save Your Deposit
Aim for at least 5% (plus costs) if using the First Home Guarantee, or 20% to avoid LMI.

### Step 4: Find Your Property
Search within your budget, keeping grant and scheme requirements in mind (e.g., property caps, new vs. established).

### Step 5: Make an Offer
Once you find the right property, make an offer subject to finance approval.

### Step 6: Finalise Your Loan
Complete your mortgage application with all required documents. Approval typically takes 1-2 weeks.

### Step 7: Settlement
Your solicitor/conveyancer handles settlement. You get the keys and move in!

## Documents Needed for First Home Buyer Loans

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I buy an investment property as my first home?
You must live in the property to access most first home buyer benefits. However, you can later convert it to an investment property.

### What if I've owned property overseas?
You may still qualify as a first home buyer in Australia, depending on the specific scheme.

### Can de facto couples both claim first home buyer benefits?
Generally, both parties must be first home buyers. If one partner has previously owned property, you may lose eligibility.

### How long do I need to live in the property?
Typically 6-12 months minimum for grants and concessions. Check your state's requirements.

### Can I use gifted funds for my deposit?
Yes, most lenders accept gifted deposits from family. You'll need a signed gift letter stating the money doesn't need to be repaid.
