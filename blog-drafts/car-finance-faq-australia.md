## Getting Started with Car Finance

### What is car finance?
Car finance is a loan that helps you purchase a vehicle. Instead of paying the full price upfront, you borrow money and repay it over time with interest. The car often serves as security for the loan.

### How does car finance work?
1. You choose a car
2. Apply for finance (through a dealer or broker)
3. Get approved for a loan amount and interest rate
4. The lender pays the seller
5. You make regular repayments until the loan is paid off
6. You own the car outright (unless there's a balloon payment)

### What types of car finance are available in Australia?
- **Secured car loan** – Car is security, lower rates
- **Unsecured personal loan** – No security required, higher rates
- **Chattel mortgage** – Popular for business use, tax benefits
- **Novated lease** – Salary sacrifice through your employer
- **Finance lease** – Business use, pay residual at end
- **Dealer finance** – Arranged through the dealership

### Should I use dealer finance or a broker?
A broker typically offers better rates. Dealers often charge 2-5% more than broker rates and have limited lender options. Always get a broker quote before accepting dealer finance.

## Eligibility & Approval

### What do I need to qualify for car finance?
- Be 18+ years old
- Be an Australian citizen or permanent resident
- Have regular income (employed, self-employed, or pension)
- Have acceptable credit history
- Meet the lender's specific criteria

### What documents do I need for car finance?
- Photo ID (driver's licence or passport)
- Proof of income (payslips or tax returns)
- Bank statements (last 90 days)
- Proof of address
- Details of the car you're purchasing

### How long does car finance approval take?
Pre-approval can take 24 hours or less. Final approval after selecting a vehicle typically takes 1-3 business days.

### Can I get pre-approved for car finance?
Yes. Pre-approval tells you how much you can borrow before you shop for a car, giving you negotiating power and budget certainty.

### Does pre-approval affect my credit score?
Most brokers do a "soft" credit check for pre-approval that doesn't affect your score. The "hard" check happens at final application.

## Credit & Eligibility Issues

### Can I get car finance with bad credit?
Yes. Specialist lenders work with borrowers who have credit issues. Rates will be higher, but options exist for:
- Past defaults
- Low credit scores
- Previous bankruptcies
- Part IX debt agreements

### What credit score do I need for car finance?
There's no universal minimum. Different lenders have different criteria:
- Prime lenders: 650+ preferred
- Near-prime: 500-649
- Specialist lenders: Below 500 possible

### Can I get car finance with no credit history?
Yes, but options are limited. Some lenders assess "thin file" applicants based on income stability and employment.

### Will I be approved if I've been bankrupt?
Possibly. Some lenders consider discharged bankrupts after 2+ years. Rates will be higher, and you may need a larger deposit.

### Can I get car finance on Centrelink?
Some lenders accept Centrelink income. Loan amounts may be limited, and you'll need to demonstrate ability to repay.

## Interest Rates & Costs

### What are typical car finance interest rates in Australia?
Rates range from about 5.99% to 25%+ depending on:
- Your credit score
- Loan security
- Loan term
- Lender
- Vehicle age

### What's the difference between interest rate and comparison rate?
The comparison rate includes fees and charges, giving a truer picture of the loan's cost. Always compare using comparison rates.

### What fees are involved in car finance?
- Establishment fee: $0-$500
- Monthly account fee: $0-$15
- Early repayment fee: $0-$500 (varies)
- PPSR registration: ~$7

### Are car loan interest payments tax deductible?
Only if the car is used for business purposes. For personal use vehicles, interest is not tax deductible.

---

## Loan Terms & Repayments

### What loan terms are available for car finance?
Typically 1-7 years. Shorter terms mean higher repayments but less total interest. Longer terms reduce payments but cost more overall.

### What's a balloon payment?
A balloon payment (or residual) is a lump sum due at the end of your loan. It lowers monthly repayments but means you owe a large amount at the end.

### Should I choose a balloon payment?
Consider it if:
- You want lower monthly payments
- You plan to sell/trade the car before term end
- You're confident you can pay or refinance the balloon

Avoid if you want to own the car outright with no future lump sum.

### Can I make extra repayments on my car loan?
Most variable rate loans allow extra repayments. Some fixed rate loans have limits or fees. Check your contract.

### Can I pay off my car loan early?
Usually yes. Some loans have early exit fees, especially fixed-rate products. Ask about early repayment terms before signing.

## Buying Process

### Can I get finance for a private sale car?
Yes. Both secured car loans and unsecured personal loans can be used for private sales. The process differs slightly from dealer purchases.

### Can I get finance for a used car?
Yes. Most lenders finance used cars up to 12-15 years old. Rates may be slightly higher than for new cars.

### Is there a maximum car age for finance?
Yes. Most lenders require the car to be under 12-15 years old at the END of the loan term. For example, a 5-year loan on a 10-year-old car may not be approved.

### Can I finance a car from an auction?
Yes, but it requires planning. You typically need pre-approval and the ability to pay quickly after auction.

### Can I get finance for an electric vehicle (EV)?
Yes. Many lenders now offer competitive rates for EVs, and some offer "green" discounts for electric and hybrid vehicles.

---

## Refinancing

### Can I refinance my car loan?
Yes. Refinancing means replacing your current loan with a new one, typically at a lower rate.

### When should I refinance my car loan?
Consider refinancing if:
- Your current rate is 2%+ above market rates
- You're paying dealer finance rates
- Your credit score has improved
- You have at least $10,000 and 12 months remaining

### How much can I save by refinancing?
Savings vary, but refinancing from 14% to 7% on a $25,000 loan saves approximately $1,750 per year.

### Can I refinance a car with negative equity?
It's difficult but possible with some lenders. Negative equity means you owe more than the car is worth.

---

## Business & Tax

### What's a chattel mortgage?
A chattel mortgage is a business finance product where you own the car from day one, but the lender holds a mortgage over it until paid off. Popular for ABN holders due to tax benefits.

### What's a novated lease?
A novated lease is a three-way agreement between you, your employer, and a finance company. Payments come from your pre-tax salary, potentially saving tax.

### Can I claim car finance on tax?
If the car is used for business:
- Interest may be tax deductible
- Depreciation can be claimed
- GST credit may be available (chattel mortgage)

Always consult an accountant for tax advice.

### Is car finance different for ABN holders?
ABN holders can access business products like chattel mortgages and finance leases with potential tax benefits. Documentation requirements differ (BAS, tax returns instead of payslips).

---

## Specific Situations

### Can I get car finance as a casual employee?
Yes. Some lenders accept casual employees with 6+ months in the role. You may need a longer employment history.

### Can I get car finance if I'm self-employed?
Yes. You'll need tax returns (usually 2 years) and possibly an accountant's letter instead of payslips.

### Can I get car finance as an international student?
Options are very limited. You typically need a co-signer who is an Australian citizen or permanent resident.

### Can I get car finance on a visa?
Some lenders accept visa holders (especially permanent visa holders). Options depend on visa type and duration.

### Can my parents go guarantor on a car loan?
Some lenders offer guarantor car loans. The guarantor becomes responsible if you default.

---

## After Approval

### Who holds the car's title during finance?
The lender registers a security interest on the Personal Property Securities Register (PPSR). They hold security until the loan is paid off.

### Can I sell my car while it's still on finance?
Yes, but the loan must be paid out from the sale proceeds before the title transfers. Contact your lender for a payout figure.

### What happens if I can't make my car loan payments?
Contact your lender immediately. Options may include:
- Hardship arrangements
- Payment pause
- Loan restructure
Ignoring the problem can lead to repossession.

### Can my car be repossessed?
Yes, if you default on payments. After typically 2-3 missed payments, lenders may begin repossession proceedings. Always communicate with your lender if you're struggling.
