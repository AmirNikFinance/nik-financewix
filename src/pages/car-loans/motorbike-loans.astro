Many lenders finance private sale motorcycle purchases.

Some online lenders offer smaller secured loans for motorcycles, and credit unions may have lower minimums than major banks."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I get a motorbike loan on a learner permit?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes — your licence status does not affect loan eligibility. Lenders assess your financial capacity, not your riding qualifications. However, you should only finance a LAMS-approved motorcycle if you are on a learner or restricted licence. Factor in potentially higher insurance premiums for learner and provisional riders."}}]}`} />

          <h2 class="font-montserrat font-bold text-2xl md:text-3xl text-[#1e3a5f] mb-6">How Motorbike Loans Work in Australia</h2>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">A motorbike loan works the same way as a car loan — you borrow a fixed amount, repay it over a set term (typically 1–7 years) with interest, and the motorcycle can serve as security for the loan (secured loan) to access lower interest rates. Motorbike finance is available from major banks, credit unions, online lenders, and specialist vehicle finance providers.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">One key difference from car loans is the typical loan amount. While the average car loan in Australia is $33,489, motorbike loans are generally smaller — ranging from $3,000 for a used scooter to $50,000+ for a new touring or adventure motorcycle. Some lenders have minimum loan amounts for secured finance (typically $5,000–$10,000), below which they only offer unsecured personal loans.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">The Australian motorcycle market is healthy, with popular brands including Honda, Yamaha, Kawasaki, Suzuki, Harley-Davidson, Ducati, BMW, Triumph, KTM, and Royal Enfield. New motorcycle sales in Australia have remained strong, with adventure and learner-approved models particularly popular categories. Lenders are familiar with these brands and their resale values, which influences both approval likelihood and interest rates offered.</p>

(specialist lenders, secured preferred)</span></li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">Motorcycles depreciate faster than cars on average, which means lenders view them as slightly higher-risk security. This is reflected in rates being marginally higher than car loans for the same borrower profile. However, premium and classic motorcycles (Harley-Davidson, Ducati, BMW GS models) hold their value well and may attract better rates.</p>

          <h2 class="font-montserrat font-bold text-2xl md:text-3xl text-[#1e3a5f] mb-6">Tips for Getting the Best Motorbike Loan</h2>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">Choose a secured loan if the bike value is above the lender's minimum threshold (typically $5,000–$10,000). Secured rates are substantially lower than unsecured — the difference can be 3–5% p.a. or more. For lower-value bikes and scooters where secured finance is not available, compare unsecured personal loan options.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">Keep the loan term as short as you can comfortably afford. Motorcycles depreciate faster than cars, and a 7-year loan on a bike that depreciates quickly creates a risk of negative equity. A 3–5 year term is usually a good balance between affordable monthly repayments and total interest cost.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">Budget for insurance. Comprehensive motorcycle insurance is typically required by lenders for secured loans. Motorcycle insurance premiums vary significantly by rider age, licence type, bike category, and location. For sport bikes ridden by younger riders, premiums can be substantial — factor this into your total ownership cost.</p>

          <h2 class="font-montserrat font-bold text-2xl md:text-3xl text-[#1e3a5f] mb-6">Business Use Motorcycle Finance</h2>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">If you use a motorcycle primarily for business — courier work, food delivery, farm use, or commuting to client sites — a chattel mortgage may be the better option. Like a car chattel mortgage, you can claim GST on the purchase, deduct interest, and claim depreciation. This is particularly relevant for delivery riders who use motorcycles and scooters as their primary business tool.</p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed">Some lenders allow you to include the cost of helmets, riding gear, and aftermarket accessories in the loan amount — particularly if purchased at the same time as the bike from the same dealer. Limits vary by lender. Adding accessories increases your total borrowing and should be factored into your budget.</p>

For smaller amounts, an unsecured personal loan is typically used. Some online lenders offer smaller secured loans for motorcycles, and credit unions may have lower minimums than major banks.</p>

Lenders assess your financial capacity, not your riding qualifications. However, you should only finance a LAMS-approved motorcycle if you are on a learner or restricted licence. Factor in potentially higher insurance premiums for learner and provisional riders.</p>
