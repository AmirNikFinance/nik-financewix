## What is Car Finance?

Car finance is a loan specifically designed to help Australians purchase a vehicle. Instead of paying the full price upfront, you borrow money from a lender and repay it over time with interest. In Australia, car finance options include secured car loans, unsecured personal loans, chattel mortgages, novated leases, and dealer finance.

## Types of Car Finance in Australia

### 1. Secured Car Loan
A secured car loan uses the vehicle as collateral. Because the lender has security, interest rates are typically lower than unsecured options.

**Best for:** Most car buyers looking for competitive rates
**Typical rates:** 5.99% - 12% p.a.
**Loan terms:** 1-7 years

### 2. Unsecured Personal Loan
An unsecured loan doesn't require the car as security. You can use the funds for any purpose, including buying a car.

**Best for:** Buyers who want flexibility or are purchasing from a private seller
**Typical rates:** 7% - 15% p.a.
**Loan terms:** 1-7 years

### 3. Chattel Mortgage
A chattel mortgage is popular with businesses and self-employed individuals. The lender provides funds to purchase the vehicle, and the car serves as security.

**Best for:** Business owners, ABN holders, self-employed
**Tax benefits:** Interest and depreciation may be tax-deductible
**Typical rates:** 5.5% - 10% p.a.

### 4. Novated Lease
A novated lease is a three-way agreement between you, your employer, and the finance company. Payments come from your pre-tax salary.

**Best for:** Employees wanting to salary sacrifice
**Tax benefits:** Significant tax savings possible
**Typical terms:** 1-5 years

### 5. Dealer Finance
Finance arranged through the car dealership. Convenient but often more expensive than going through a broker.

**Best for:** Convenience seekers (but shop around first)
**Warning:** Dealer rates are typically 2-4% higher than broker rates

## How Much Can I Borrow for a Car?

Your borrowing capacity depends on several factors:

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Income | Higher income = higher borrowing capacity |
| Existing debts | More debt = lower capacity |
| Credit score | Better score = better rates and higher limits |
| Employment type | Permanent > casual/contract |
| Living expenses | Lower expenses = higher capacity |

**General rule:** Most lenders allow car loan repayments up to 15-20% of your gross monthly income.

### Example Borrowing Capacity

| Annual Income | Approximate Max Loan |
|---------------|---------------------|
| $50,000 | $25,000 - $35,000 |
| $75,000 | $40,000 - $55,000 |
| $100,000 | $55,000 - $75,000 |
| $150,000+ | $80,000+ |

*Note: These are estimates. Your actual borrowing capacity depends on your complete financial situation.*

## Car Finance Interest Rates in Australia (2026)

Interest rates vary significantly based on your credit profile and the lender:

| Credit Profile | Typical Rate Range |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Excellent (800+) | 5.99% - 7.99% |
| Good (700-799) | 7.99% - 9.99% |
| Average (600-699) | 9.99% - 12.99% |
| Fair (500-599) | 12.99% - 18.99% |
| Poor (<500) | 18.99% - 28.99% |

## What Documents Do I Need for Car Finance?

### Standard Requirements
- ✅ Driver's licence or photo ID
- ✅ Proof of income (2 recent payslips or tax returns)
- ✅ Bank statements (last 90 days)
- ✅ Proof of address (utility bill or bank statement)

### Self-Employed Additional Requirements

## How to Get the Best Car Finance Deal

### Step 1: Know Your Credit Score
Check your credit score for free through Equifax or Credit Savvy before applying. This helps you understand what rates you qualify for.

### Step 2: Get Pre-Approved
Pre-approval gives you a clear budget and negotiating power at the dealership. It's free and doesn't affect your credit score with most brokers.

### Step 3: Compare Multiple Lenders
Don't accept the first offer. A broker can compare 130+ lenders in minutes to find your best deal.

### Step 4: Negotiate the Car Price First
Never discuss finance with the dealer until you've agreed on the car price. This prevents them from manipulating numbers.

### Step 5: Read the Fine Print
Check for:
- Early repayment fees
- Establishment fees
- Monthly account fees
- Balloon payments

## Should I Finance Through a Dealer or Broker?

| Factor | Dealer Finance | Broker (Nik Finance) |
|--------|---------------|---------------------|
| Interest rates | Higher (typically +2-4%) | Lower (access to 130+ lenders) |
| Convenience | Same location | Online or phone |
| Choice | 1-3 lenders | 130+ lenders |
| Negotiation | Limited | Full market comparison |
| Independence | Commission-driven | Your best interest |

**Our recommendation:** Always get a broker quote before accepting dealer finance. You could save thousands over the loan term.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I get car finance with bad credit?
Yes. While rates will be higher, specialist lenders work with Australians who have credit issues. A broker can match you with the right lender.

### How long does car finance approval take?
With a broker like Nik Finance, pre-approval can take as little as 24 hours. Final approval after vehicle selection is typically 1-3 business days.

### Can I pay off my car loan early?
Most car loans allow early repayment. Some have early exit fees, so check your contract. We can help you find loans with no early repayment penalties.

### Is it better to get a short or long loan term?
Shorter terms mean higher repayments but less interest paid overall. Longer terms reduce monthly payments but cost more in total interest. We recommend the shortest term you can comfortably afford.

### What's a balloon payment?
A balloon payment is a lump sum due at the end of the loan. It reduces monthly repayments but means you'll owe a large amount at the end. Consider carefully before choosing this option.
