## Home Loans for Self-Employed Australians

Self-employed? Contractor? ABN holder? Getting a home loan is absolutely possible – you just need the right approach and the right lender.

## Types of Self-Employed Home Loans

### Full Doc Self-Employed Loan
Standard home loan using full financial documentation.

**Requirements:**
- 2 years tax returns
- 2 years financial statements
- ATO Notice of Assessment
- Accountant letter (some lenders)

**Rates:** Same as PAYG employees (best rates)

### Low Doc Home Loan
Reduced documentation requirements for established businesses.

**Requirements:**
- 12-24 months ABN registration
- BAS statements OR
- Accountant declaration OR
- Bank statements showing income

**Rates:** 0.5% - 1.5% higher than full doc

### Alt Doc / Bank Statement Loan
Uses bank statements to verify income instead of tax returns.

**Requirements:**
- 6-12 months business bank statements
- ABN registration
- Sometimes a declaration

**Rates:** Variable, typically higher than full doc

## Self-Employed Lending Criteria

| Requirement | Full Doc | Low Doc |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| ABN registration | 2+ years | 12-24 months |
| Tax returns | 2 years | Not required |
| BAS | Helpful | Often required |
| Accountant letter | Sometimes | Usually required |
| Max LVR | Up to 95% | Up to 80% |

## Income Calculation for Self-Employed

Banks calculate self-employed income differently than you might:

### What Lenders Use
- **Sole traders:** Net profit + add-backs
- **Companies:** Salary + dividends + retained earnings
- **Trusts:** Distributions + retained earnings

### Common Add-Backs
- Depreciation
- Interest on existing loans
- One-off expenses
- Personal expenses through business

### The Problem
Many self-employed people show lower income on tax returns to minimise tax. This reduces borrowing power with banks.

**Solution:** Low doc loans assess income differently, potentially allowing higher borrowing.

## Low Doc Home Loan Options

### BAS-Based Assessment
Lenders calculate income from your Business Activity Statements:
- Annual turnover from BAS
- Apply industry profit margin
- Result = assessed income

### Accountant Declaration
Your accountant certifies your income:
- Current income level
- Business viability
- Expected future income

### Bank Statement Assessment
Lenders analyse business deposits:
- Average monthly deposits
- Regularity of income
- Business cash flow

## Deposit Requirements

| Loan Type | Minimum Deposit | LMI Required? |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| Full doc | 5-20% | Yes if <20% |
| Low doc | 20-40% | Often waived |
| Alt doc | 20-30% | Varies |

Low doc loans typically require larger deposits to offset the reduced documentation.

## Self-Employed Home Loan Rates (2026)

### Do I need an accountant?
