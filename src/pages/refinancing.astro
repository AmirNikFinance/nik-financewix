    question: 'When is the right time to refinance my loan?',
    answer: 'Consider refinancing when interest rates have dropped since you took out your loan, your credit score has improved, your fixed rate period is ending, you want to access equity, or you are paying more than you should compared to current market rates. As a general rule, if you can reduce your rate by 0.5% or more, refinancing is often worthwhile. Our team provides a free assessment to determine whether switching will save you money after accounting for any exit costs.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What are the costs involved in refinancing?',
    answer: 'Refinancing costs can include discharge fees from your current lender (typically $150 to $400), government registration fees, and potential break costs if you are exiting a fixed-rate loan early. Many new lenders offer cashback deals or waive application fees to offset these costs. In most cases, the long-term savings from a lower rate far exceed the one-off switching costs. Your NIK Finance specialist will provide a detailed cost-benefit analysis before you commit.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does the refinancing process work?',
    answer: 'The process begins with an assessment of your current loan and financial position. We then compare your existing deal against products from 130+ lenders to identify better options. Once you choose a new lender, we manage the full application, including valuations, documentation, and coordination between old and new lenders. The transition is designed to be seamless with minimal disruption to your repayments.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much could I save by refinancing?',
    answer: 'Savings depend on your current rate, loan balance, and remaining term. For example, reducing the rate on a $500,000 home loan by 0.5% could save over $50,000 in interest over the life of a 30-year loan. Car loan refinancing can also deliver significant savings, particularly if your credit profile has improved since taking out the original loan. We provide a personalised savings estimate as part of our free assessment.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I refinance if I have a fixed rate loan?',
    answer: 'Yes, but you may need to pay break costs to exit the fixed term early. Break costs are calculated by the lender and can vary significantly depending on how far you are into the fixed period and how much rates have changed. In some cases, the savings from a lower rate still outweigh the break costs. We always calculate the net benefit before recommending a switch from a fixed rate product.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I refinance a car loan or personal loan, not just a home loan?',
    answer: 'Absolutely. Refinancing is not limited to home loans. If you have a car loan with a high interest rate, a personal loan with unfavourable terms, or even a business loan that is no longer competitive, we can help you find a better deal. Our lender panel covers all major loan types, and the same AI-powered matching process applies to find you the most competitive replacement product.',

            If your property has increased in value, refinancing can let you access the built-up equity for
            renovations, investing, or other purposes. This is often more cost-effective than taking out a
