## Investment Property Loans Explained

An investment property loan finances a property you don't live in – it's rented out or held for capital growth. Investment loans have different rates, tax treatment, and lending criteria compared to owner-occupied loans.

## Investment vs. Owner-Occupied Loans

| Factor | Investment Loan | Owner-Occupied |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| Interest rates | +0.2% to +0.5% higher | Lower |
| Max LVR | Usually 80-90% | Up to 95% |
| Interest-only | More common | Less common |
| Tax deductible | Yes (interest) | No |
| Serviceability | Stricter | Standard |

## Investment Loan Interest Rates (2026)

| Loan Type | Rate Range |
|-----------|------------|
| Variable P&I | 5.8% - 7.3% |
| Variable IO | 6.2% - 7.8% |
| Fixed 2-year | 6.0% - 7.2% |

*Rates vary by LVR, lender, and borrower profile.*

## Interest-Only Loans for Investors

### How Interest-Only Works
You pay only the interest for a set period (typically 1-5 years). The loan balance doesn't reduce.

### Why Investors Choose IO
- Lower repayments = better cash flow
- Maximise tax deductions (interest is deductible)
- Direct extra funds to other investments
- Flexibility during portfolio building

### The Trade-Off
- Loan balance stays the same
- Higher total interest over loan life
- Revert to P&I after IO period (higher repayments)

## Tax Benefits of Investment Loans

### Interest Deductibility
Interest on your investment loan is tax deductible against rental income.

**Example:**
- Rental income: $30,000/year
- Loan interest: $25,000/year
- Deductible expense: $25,000
- Taxable rental income: $5,000

### Negative Gearing
When expenses exceed rental income, the loss reduces your taxable income.

**Example:**
- Rental income: $30,000
- Interest + expenses: $40,000
- Loss: $10,000
- At 37% tax rate: $3,700 tax saving

### Depreciation
Claim depreciation on the building and fixtures:
- Building: 2.5% per year (for properties built after 1985)
- Fixtures: Various rates (appliances, carpets, etc.)

A quantity surveyor's depreciation schedule can identify $5,000-$15,000+ in annual deductions.

## Building an Investment Portfolio

### Portfolio Strategy 1: Equity Recycling
1. Buy property 1, build equity
2. Use equity as deposit for property 2
3. Repeat

### Portfolio Strategy 2: Cash Flow Focus
Buy high-yield properties that are positively geared (rent covers all costs plus profit).

### Portfolio Strategy 3: Growth Focus
Buy in high-growth areas. Accept negative gearing for capital appreciation.

### Portfolio Strategy 4: Hybrid
Mix of cash flow and growth properties for balanced portfolio.

## Using Equity to Buy Investment Property

### Accessing Home Equity
If your home has increased in value, you can refinance to access equity for an investment deposit.

**Example:**
- Home value: $800,000
- Home loan: $400,000
- Available equity (80% LVR): $240,000
- Usable for investment deposit: $240,000

### Cross-Collateralisation Warning
Some lenders want to secure both properties together. This can be problematic:
- Limits flexibility
- Complicates future sales/refinancing
- Better to keep loans separate

## Investment Loan Structures

### Standalone Loans
Each property has its own separate loan. Maximum flexibility.

### Line of Credit
Access equity as needed. Good for experienced investors.

### Split Loans
Part fixed (certainty) + part variable (flexibility).

### Offset Accounts
Keep savings offsetting your home loan, not investment loan (to maximise investment interest deductions).

## Borrowing Capacity for Investors

Lenders assess investment loans more conservatively:

### Rental Income Shading
Lenders only count 70-80% of expected rental income to allow for vacancies and expenses.

### Higher Buffer Rates
Assessment rates may be higher than owner-occupied loans.

### Multiple Properties
Each additional property reduces borrowing power due to debt accumulation.

## Investment Property Location Factors

### Consider:
- Rental yield
- Vacancy rates
- Capital growth history
- Infrastructure development
- Population growth
- Employment diversity

### Yield vs. Growth
| Property Type | Typical Yield | Typical Growth |
|---------------|--------------|----------------|
| Inner city apartment | 4-5% | Moderate |
| Regional house | 5-7% | Variable |
| Capital city house | 3-4% | Higher |
| Blue chip suburb | 2-3% | Premium |

## Investment Property Costs

### Buying Costs
- Stamp duty (investor rates – no concessions)
- Legal fees
- Building/pest inspection
- Loan establishment fees

### Ongoing Costs
- Interest repayments
- Council rates
- Insurance (landlord)
- Property management (8-10% of rent)
- Maintenance
- Body corporate (if applicable)

## Property Investment Risks

### Market Risk
Property values can fall. Some areas underperform for years.

### Vacancy Risk
Periods without tenants mean no income but ongoing costs.

### Interest Rate Risk
Rising rates increase costs and reduce cash flow.

### Tenant Risk
Problem tenants can cause damage and stress.

### Liquidity Risk
Property can't be sold quickly like shares. Settlement takes months.

## First Investment Property Tips

1. **Start with solid research** – Don't buy emotionally
2. **Get finance pre-approved** – Know your budget
3. **Use a buyer's agent** – They know the market
4. **Get a depreciation schedule** – Maximise tax benefits
5. **Hire a property manager** – Worth the 8-10% fee
6. **Keep separate accounts** – Don't mix personal and investment
7. **Have a buffer** – 3-6 months of expenses in reserve

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I live in my investment property?
If you move in, it becomes owner-occupied. Tax treatment changes. CGT exemption may apply.

### How many investment properties can I have?
As many as your borrowing capacity allows. Serviceability gets harder with each property.

### Should I pay principal or interest-only?
Interest-only is popular for investors due to cash flow and tax benefits. Consult your accountant.

### Can I claim a property inspection trip?
Potentially, if the primary purpose is inspecting your investment. Get tax advice.

### What happens if I sell at a loss?
Capital losses can be offset against capital gains (not income). Unused losses carry forward.
