- ✅ Discharged bankruptcies (typically 2+ years)
- ✅ Part IX debt agreements (discharged)

| Unpaid defaults | 8% - 11% | Up to 80% |
| Discharged bankruptcy | 7.5% - 10% | Up to 80% |

*Rates and LVR depend on the severity and age of credit issues.*

## What Specialist Lenders Consider

### Primary Focus
- **Equity/Deposit:** More equity = more options
- **Current income:** Can you afford repayments?
- **Exit strategy:** Can you refinance to a better rate later?
- **Property type:** Standard properties preferred

### Secondary Considerations
- Age of credit issues
- Explanation for problems
- Steps taken to resolve issues
- Overall debt levels

## Minimum Requirements (Generally)

| Factor | Typical Requirement |
|--------|-------------------|
| Deposit | 15-30% (higher = better rates) |
| Employment | Stable income, any type |
| Bankruptcy discharge | 2+ years ago |
| Part IX discharge | 2+ years ago |
| Property | Standard residential |

## Bad Credit Home Loan Options

### Non-Conforming Lenders
Specialist lenders designed for borrowers who don't fit bank criteria. Higher rates but flexible assessment.

### Private Lenders
Short-term solutions (1-2 years) while you repair credit. Very high rates but minimal criteria.

### Low Doc Loans
For self-employed borrowers with credit issues who can't provide full documentation.

### Guarantor Loans
Family security can help overcome credit issues and reduce deposit requirements.

## The Path to Prime Lending

Bad credit home loans are often a stepping stone:

**Year 1-2:** Bad credit loan at higher rate
**Year 2-3:** Credit improves, refinance to near-prime
**Year 3+:** Refinance to prime rates

This strategy has helped thousands of Australians become homeowners despite credit issues.

## How to Improve Your Chances

### 1. Save More Deposit
30%+ deposit opens many doors that 20% doesn't.

### 2. Pay Small Defaults
Defaults under $1,000 are often worth paying before applying.

### 3. Provide Explanation
Lenders want to understand what happened and why it won't recur.

### 4. Show Savings History
Regular savings demonstrates financial responsibility.

### 5. Avoid New Credit
Don't apply for anything else before your home loan.

### 6. Use a Specialist Broker
We know which lenders suit specific credit profiles.

## Documents Needed

- ✅ Photo ID
- ✅ Income evidence (payslips, tax returns)
- ✅ Bank statements (3-6 months)
- ✅ Asset and liability statement
- ✅ Credit report (we can obtain)
- ✅ Default explanations

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long after bankruptcy can I get a home loan?
Most lenders require 2+ years since discharge. Some consider earlier with strong circumstances.

### Can I get a home loan with unpaid defaults?
Yes, but options are limited and rates higher. Paying defaults before applying improves options significantly.

### What deposit do I need with bad credit?
Typically 15-30%. Higher deposits mean better rates and more lender options.

### Will my rate improve over time?
Yes. After 1-2 years of clean conduct and on-time payments, you can often refinance to significantly better rates.

### Can I buy an investment property with bad credit?
Yes, though options are more limited than for owner-occupied. Higher deposits usually required.
