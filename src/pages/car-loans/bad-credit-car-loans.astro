          <h2 class="font-montserrat font-bold text-2xl md:text-3xl text-[#1e3a5f] mb-6">What Counts as Bad Credit in Australia?</h2>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">In Australia, your credit history is recorded by three main credit reporting agencies: Equifax, Experian, and illion. Each maintains a credit score based on your borrowing and repayment history. An Equifax score below 500 is generally considered below average, while a score below 350 is considered low. However, your numeric score is only part of the picture. Lenders also look at specific events on your credit file that may indicate higher risk.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">Common credit issues that make getting a standard car loan difficult include:</p>

          <h2 class="font-montserrat font-bold text-2xl md:text-3xl text-[#1e3a5f] mb-6">How Bad Credit Car Loans Work in Australia</h2>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">Specialist lenders — sometimes called non-conforming, sub-prime, or second-chance lenders — assess your application differently to banks. Rather than automatically declining based on a credit score threshold, they take a holistic view of your situation. They focus heavily on your current ability to repay rather than solely on past credit events.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">When assessing a bad credit application, specialist lenders typically consider your current employment status and stability, income level relative to proposed repayments and living expenses, how long ago credit events occurred, whether defaults are paid or unpaid, the amount and number of defaults, your overall financial trajectory, whether you have a deposit, and the type of vehicle you are purchasing.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">Secured car loans — where the vehicle acts as collateral — are generally easier to obtain with bad credit because the lender has an asset to fall back on. Unsecured options exist but carry significantly higher rates.</p>

          <h2 class="font-montserrat font-bold text-2xl md:text-3xl text-[#1e3a5f] mb-6">Current Rates and What to Expect (February 2026)</h2>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">Bad credit car loan rates in Australia vary enormously. As a guide based on early 2026 broker data:</p>
          <h3 class="font-montserrat font-semibold text-xl text-[#0d4d3e] mt-8 mb-4">Minor Credit Issues</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">One or two small paid defaults over 2 years old — expect rates of 9–12% p.a.</p>
          <h3 class="font-montserrat font-semibold text-xl text-[#0d4d3e] mt-8 mb-4">Moderate Credit Issues</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">Multiple defaults, some unpaid, or a recently discharged debt agreement — rates typically 12–16% p.a.</p>
          <h3 class="font-montserrat font-semibold text-xl text-[#0d4d3e] mt-8 mb-4">Serious Credit Issues</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">Recent large defaults, current Part IX agreement, or recently discharged bankruptcy — rates 16–24% p.a.</p>
          <div class="bg-[#0d4d3e]/5 border-l-4 border-[#10b981] rounded-r-lg p-6 my-6">
            <p class="text-[#0d4d3e] font-lato font-light leading-relaxed">For comparison, excellent credit borrowers access rates from 5.09% p.a. for green vehicles and 5.49% for standard new cars. The average prime rate is approximately 7.20% p.a. The RBA cash rate sits at 3.85% following the February 2026 increase.</p>

          <h2 class="font-montserrat font-bold text-2xl md:text-3xl text-[#1e3a5f] mb-6">How to Improve Your Chances of Approval</h2>
          <h3 class="font-montserrat font-semibold text-xl text-[#0d4d3e] mt-8 mb-4">Save a Deposit</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">Even 10–20% of the vehicle value demonstrates financial responsibility and reduces lender risk. This meaningfully improves both approval odds and the rate offered.</p>
          <h3 class="font-montserrat font-semibold text-xl text-[#0d4d3e] mt-8 mb-4">Pay Off Small Outstanding Defaults</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">Clearing small defaults before applying can make a significant difference. A credit file with all-paid defaults is viewed much more favourably than one with outstanding debts.</p>
          <h3 class="font-montserrat font-semibold text-xl text-[#0d4d3e] mt-8 mb-4">Check Your Credit Report for Errors</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">You are entitled to a free credit report from each agency annually. Review carefully for errors — incorrect defaults, wrong details, or debts already paid that have not been updated. Dispute inaccuracies directly with the agency.</p>
          <h3 class="font-montserrat font-semibold text-xl text-[#0d4d3e] mt-8 mb-4">Stabilise Your Employment</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">Lenders like to see 3–6 months in your current job and at your current address. If you have recently changed roles, waiting a few months before applying can help.</p>
          <h3 class="font-montserrat font-semibold text-xl text-[#0d4d3e] mt-8 mb-4">Use a Broker Instead of Applying Directly</h3>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">Every formal application leaves a hard enquiry on your file. Multiple applications to different lenders further damage your score. A broker submits to lenders most likely to approve your situation, minimising unnecessary enquiries.</p>

          <h2 class="font-montserrat font-bold text-2xl md:text-3xl text-[#1e3a5f] mb-6">Why Use Nik Finance for a Bad Credit Car Loan?</h2>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">Unlike going directly to a single bank, Nik Finance has access to over 130 lenders, including multiple specialist non-conforming lenders who specifically cater to borrowers with impaired credit. This dramatically increases your chances of finding an approval.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">Our service is completely free — we are paid by the lender upon settlement. We start with a soft credit check that does not impact your score, so you can explore options with zero risk. Our brokers understand which lenders are most favourable for different types of credit issues and can present your application in the best possible light.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">We also help you understand whether now is the right time to apply or whether waiting — for example, until a default ages past a key threshold or until you have saved a deposit — might result in a significantly better outcome.</p>

          <h2 class="font-montserrat font-bold text-2xl md:text-3xl text-[#1e3a5f] mb-6">Rebuilding Your Credit Through a Car Loan</h2>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">One of the underappreciated benefits of a bad credit car loan is the opportunity to rebuild your credit score through consistent, on-time repayments. Under Australia's comprehensive credit reporting system, positive repayment history is recorded alongside negative events. Every on-time repayment adds a positive data point to your credit file.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">After 12–24 months of consistent repayments, your score should improve noticeably. At that point, you may be eligible to refinance at a lower rate, potentially saving hundreds or thousands over the remaining term. Nik Finance can help review your refinancing options when the time is right.</p>
