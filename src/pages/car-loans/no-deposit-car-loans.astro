        <h2 class="font-montserrat font-bold text-2xl md:text-3xl text-[#1e3a5f] mb-6">How No Deposit Car Loans Work</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">A no deposit car loan is vehicle finance where the lender provides 100% of the purchase price. Instead of paying a portion upfront, you borrow the entire amount and repay over the loan term (typically 1–7 years) with interest. Most no deposit car loans are secured, meaning the vehicle itself acts as collateral.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">When you apply, the lender assesses your ability to afford the full repayment amount. Because you are not reducing the loan with a deposit, your regular repayments will be higher. The lender looks at your income (after tax), existing financial commitments, living expenses, employment history, credit score, and the vehicle being purchased.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">Some lenders also allow you to include on-road costs — registration, stamp duty, comprehensive insurance, and dealer delivery fees — in the loan amount. This means you could drive away with absolutely zero upfront costs, though you will be borrowing more than the car's value.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="mb-16">
        <h2 class="font-montserrat font-bold text-2xl md:text-3xl text-[#1e3a5f] mb-6">No Deposit Car Loan Rates and Costs (2026)</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">Many lenders offer the same advertised interest rate regardless of whether a deposit is paid. The difference is in total cost because you borrow a larger amount.</p>
        <div class="bg-[#0d4d3e]/5 border-l-4 border-[#10b981] rounded-r-lg p-6 my-6"><p class="text-[#0d4d3e] font-lato font-light leading-relaxed">Example on a $35,000 car at 7% p.a. over 5 years: No deposit = ~$693/month, $6,580 total interest. With 10% deposit ($3,500 down) = ~$624/month, $5,920 interest — saving $69/month and $660 total. With 20% deposit ($7,000 down) = ~$554/month, $5,260 interest — saving $139/month and $1,320 total.</p></div>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">While a deposit saves money overall, if you need a car now and do not have savings available, a no deposit loan gets you mobile immediately. You can always make extra repayments later to reduce your balance faster.</p>

      <section class="mb-16">
        <h2 class="font-montserrat font-bold text-2xl md:text-3xl text-[#1e3a5f] mb-6">Who Offers No Deposit Car Loans?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">Most car loan lenders in Australia offer no deposit options, including major banks like NAB, St George, and Macquarie, as well as specialist vehicle finance lenders like Pepper Money, Liberty, Latitude, and many more. Credit unions often offer competitive rates with no deposit requirements.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">Eligibility generally requires a reasonable credit history (though specialist lenders can help with impaired credit), stable employment or regular income, and the ability to demonstrate you can comfortably afford the repayments. For borrowers with excellent credit, approval with no deposit is typically straightforward.</p>

      <section class="mb-16">
        <h2 class="font-montserrat font-bold text-2xl md:text-3xl text-[#1e3a5f] mb-6">Benefits and Risks of No Deposit Car Finance</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">The main benefit is obvious — you can get a car now without needing to save for months or years. This is valuable if you need a vehicle urgently for a new job, family needs, or because your current car has broken down. It also preserves cash for other expenses like insurance, registration, or an emergency fund.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 font-lato font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">The main risk is negative equity. New cars depreciate 15–20% in the first year. If you finance 100% with no deposit, you may owe more than the car is worth for the first one to three years. If you need to sell during this period, sale proceeds may not cover the outstanding balance. Mitigate this by choosing a car that holds its value, making extra repayments, and opting for a shorter loan term.</p>
