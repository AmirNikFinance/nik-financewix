# Unlock Savings: A Complete Guide to Refinancing Your Home Loan (2026)

## Key Takeaways

- Average savings from refinancing: **$200-$500 per month** or **$50,000+ over the loan term**
- Best time to refinance: when your rate is **0.5%+ above current market rates**
- Refinancing costs: **$500-$3,000** (often recovered within 3-6 months of savings)
- No minimum time before you can refinance — you can switch anytime
- Cashback offers from lenders: **$2,000-$5,000** when switching
- Nik Finance compares 130+ lenders free — no fees, no obligation

## TL;DR

**If you haven't reviewed your home loan in the last 12 months, you're probably paying too much.**

Interest rates have moved significantly. Banks offer their best rates to new customers, not loyal ones. Refinancing lets you access those better rates — and potentially unlock equity for renovations, investments, or paying off other debt.

## What Is Home Loan Refinancing?

Refinancing means replacing your current home loan with a new one — either with your existing lender or a different one.

**You might refinance to:**
- Get a lower interest rate
- Access equity (cash out)
- Consolidate debts
- Switch from variable to fixed (or vice versa)
- Remove a guarantor
- Change loan features (offset, redraw, etc.)

### Savings Calculator

**Example: $500,000 loan, 25 years remaining**

| Current Rate | New Rate | Monthly Saving | Annual Saving | Total Over Loan |
|--------------|----------|----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| 7.00% | 6.00% | $304 | $3,648 | $58,000 |
| 6.50% | 5.75% | $228 | $2,736 | $42,000 |
| 6.00% | 5.50% | $152 | $1,824 | $27,000 |

**Even a 0.5% rate reduction on a $500,000 loan saves ~$150/month.**

## When Should You Refinance?

### ✅ Refinance If:

**1. Your rate is 0.5%+ above current market rates**
Banks don't automatically give you their best rates. You have to ask — or switch.

**2. Your fixed rate is ending**
When fixed terms expire, you'll revert to the bank's (often higher) variable rate. This is the perfect time to shop around.

**3. Your circumstances have improved**
Better income, more equity, or improved credit score? You may now qualify for rates you couldn't get before.

**4. You want to access equity**
Home values have increased significantly. Refinancing can let you access that equity for renovations, investments, or other purposes.

**5. You want to consolidate debt**
Rolling high-interest debts (credit cards, car loans, personal loans) into your mortgage can save thousands in interest — just be careful not to extend the term.

**6. Your needs have changed**
Need an offset account? Want to switch from P&I to interest-only (or vice versa)? A new lender might offer better features.

### ❌ Maybe Don't Refinance If:

- You're planning to sell within 12 months
- You have less than 20% equity (may face LMI again)
- Your credit score has dropped significantly
- Switching costs outweigh potential savings

## The True Cost of Refinancing

### Exit Costs (Your Current Lender)
| Fee | Typical Cost |
|-----|--------------|
| Discharge fee | $150 - $400 |
| Break cost (fixed loans only) | $0 - $10,000+ |
| Government fees | $100 - $200 |

### Entry Costs (New Lender)
| Fee | Typical Cost |
|-----|--------------|
| Application fee | $0 - $600 |
| Valuation fee | $0 - $300 |
| Settlement fee | $0 - $300 |
| Legal/conveyancing | $200 - $500 |

### Total Typical Cost: $500 - $3,000
(Excluding fixed rate break costs)

### The Break-Even Calculation

**Total refinancing cost ÷ monthly savings = months to break even**

**Example:**
- Refinancing costs: $1,500
- Monthly savings: $250
- Break-even: 6 months

If you're planning to keep the loan longer than the break-even period, refinancing makes financial sense.

## Cashback Offers: Free Money?

Many lenders offer **$2,000 - $5,000 cashback** to attract refinancers.

### Current Cashback Offers (February 2026)
- Some lenders offering up to $4,000 for loans over $250,000
- Often tiered: larger loans = larger cashback
- Can offset most or all refinancing costs

**Caution:** Don't choose a loan purely for cashback. A lower rate usually saves more over time than a one-off payment.

## Step-by-Step: How to Refinance Your Home Loan

### Step 1: Gather Your Current Loan Details
- Current interest rate
- Loan balance
- Remaining term
- Any fixed rate periods and expiry dates
- Current lender's discharge fees

### Step 2: Check Your Property Value
Your loan-to-value ratio (LVR) affects available rates. Use recent sales in your area or get an online estimate.

**LVR Calculation:**
Loan Balance ÷ Property Value × 100 = LVR%

| LVR | Impact |
|-----|--------|
| Under 60% | Best rates available |
| 60-80% | Good rates |
| 80-90% | Standard rates, may need LMI |
| Over 90% | Limited options, LMI required |

### Step 3: Compare Loan Options
Don't just call your current bank. Compare across the market. Nik Finance compares 130+ lenders to find your best option.

### Step 4: Apply for the New Loan
You'll need:
- Proof of income (payslips, tax returns)
- ID documents
- Current loan statements
- Property details

### Step 5: Approval and Valuation
The new lender will:
- Assess your application
- Order a property valuation
- Issue conditional then unconditional approval

### Step 6: Settlement
- New lender pays out old loan
- Your mortgage transfers to new lender
- Usually takes 2-4 weeks from approval

## Should You Stay or Switch?

### Negotiate With Your Current Lender First

Before refinancing, call your lender's retention team:
- Ask what their best rate is for someone with your profile
- Mention you're considering refinancing
- They may match or beat competitor offers

**Script:** "I've been comparing home loans and found rates around [X%]. I'd like to stay with you, but I'll need you to match that rate. What can you do?"

### When Switching Makes More Sense

- Your lender won't negotiate
- You want features they don't offer
- You want to consolidate debts or access equity
- A new lender is offering significantly better terms

## Refinancing for Different Purposes

### To Lower Your Rate
The most common reason. Even small rate reductions add up over 20-30 years.

### To Access Equity (Cash Out)
Turn your home's increased value into usable funds:
- Home renovations
- Investment property deposit
- Share investments
- Emergency fund

**Example:** Home worth $800,000, loan balance $400,000 = $400,000 equity. You might be able to access $240,000 (80% LVR limit).

### To Consolidate Debt
Roll high-interest debts into your mortgage:
- Credit cards (15-22% → 6%)
- Personal loans (10-15% → 6%)
- Car loans (7-12% → 6%)

**Warning:** While you'll pay less interest, you'll pay it over a longer period. Consider keeping the same total repayment amount to pay off faster.

### To Remove LMI
If you originally borrowed with less than 20% deposit, you're paying Lenders Mortgage Insurance. Once you reach 80% LVR, refinancing can remove this cost.

### To Change Loan Type
- Variable to fixed (lock in certainty)
- Fixed to variable (gain flexibility)
- P&I to interest-only (lower payments temporarily)
- Interest-only to P&I (build equity faster)

## Common Refinancing Mistakes

### 1. Only Comparing Interest Rates
Fees, features, and flexibility matter too. A loan with a slightly higher rate but no fees and a good offset account might cost you less overall.

### 2. Ignoring Break Costs on Fixed Loans
If you're on a fixed rate, check break costs before committing. They can be substantial if rates have fallen.

### 3. Extending Your Loan Term
If you refinance and restart a 30-year term, you'll pay more interest overall — even at a lower rate. Try to match your remaining term.

### 4. Not Accounting for All Costs
Include government fees, legal costs, and your time. Make sure savings outweigh total costs.

### 5. Doing Too Many Credit Checks
Each formal application affects your credit score. Use a broker to compare options with a single credit check.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How often can I refinance my home loan?
There's no legal limit. However, frequent refinancing has costs and credit impacts. Most people refinance every 2-4 years or when rates move significantly.

### Will refinancing affect my credit score?
The initial credit check may temporarily reduce your score by a few points. However, having a well-managed mortgage is positive for your credit profile.

### Can I refinance if I'm self-employed?
Yes. Self-employed borrowers typically need 2 years of tax returns or financials. Some lenders offer "low doc" loans with fewer requirements at slightly higher rates.

### Can I refinance with bad credit?
It's harder but possible. Specialist lenders cater to borrowers with impaired credit. Rates will be higher, but you can refinance again once your credit improves.

### How long does refinancing take?
Typically 2-6 weeks from application to settlement, depending on lender turnaround times and documentation.

### Do I need a conveyancer/solicitor?
Yes, for the legal transfer of the mortgage. Most lenders include this in their package or recommend providers. Cost: $200-$500.
