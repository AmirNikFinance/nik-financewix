## What is a Credit Score?

A credit score is a numerical representation of your creditworthiness – how likely you are to repay borrowed money. In Australia, scores typically range from 0 to 1,200 (Equifax) or 0 to 1,000 (other bureaus).

## Credit Score Ranges

### Equifax Scale (Most Common)
| Score Range | Rating | What It Means |
|-------------|--------|---------------|
| 833 - 1,200 | Excellent | Best rates, easy approval |
| 726 - 832 | Very Good | Good rates, most products available |
| 622 - 725 | Good | Standard rates, most products available |
| 510 - 621 | Average | Some limitations, higher rates |
| 0 - 509 | Below Average | Limited options, specialist lenders |

### Other Bureaus
- **Experian:** 0 - 1,000
- **illion:** 0 - 1,000

Scores vary between bureaus – check all three for a complete picture.

## What Affects Your Credit Score?

### Positive Factors ✅
- On-time repayments
- Long credit history
- Mix of credit types
- Low credit utilisation
- Stable address history
- Limited credit applications

### Negative Factors ❌
- Late payments
- Defaults
- Too many credit applications
- High credit utilisation
- Court judgments
- Bankruptcy

## How Credit Scores Are Calculated

### Payment History (35-40%)
Your track record of paying bills on time. Even one late payment can hurt.

### Credit Utilisation (20-30%)
How much of your available credit you're using. Below 30% is ideal.

### Credit History Length (10-15%)
Longer history = better. Old accounts in good standing help.

### Credit Mix (10%)
Having different types of credit (cards, loans, mortgage) shows you can manage various obligations.

### New Credit Applications (10%)
Multiple applications in a short period signal risk.

4. **Diversify credit types** – Mix of cards and loans

4. **Consider secured credit card** – Rebuild with responsible use

## Common Credit Score Myths

### Myth 1: Checking Your Score Hurts It
**False.** Checking your own score is a "soft inquiry" – no impact.

### Myth 2: Closing Old Cards Helps
**False.** Closing old accounts shortens credit history and can hurt.

### Myth 3: Income Affects Your Score
**False.** Income isn't on your credit report. Scores measure credit behaviour, not wealth.

### Myth 4: All Debt is Bad
**False.** Responsibly managed debt (paid on time) improves your score.

### Myth 5: Paying Off a Default Removes It
**False.** Paid defaults stay on your report for 5 years but marked as "paid."

## How Lenders Use Credit Scores

### Approval Decision
Minimum scores often required for various products:
- Prime home loans: 600+
- Good rate personal loans: 650+
- Best rates: 750+

### Interest Rate Pricing
Better scores = lower rates. The difference can be thousands of dollars.

### Credit Limit Setting
Higher scores may qualify for higher limits.

## Credit Score Impact Timeline

| Event | Score Impact | Time on Report |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| Credit inquiry | Minor (10-20 pts) | 5 years |
| Late payment | Moderate (50-100 pts) | 2 years |
| Default | Severe (100-200 pts) | 5 years |
| Court judgment | Severe | 5 years |
| Bankruptcy | Severe | 5-7 years |
| Debt agreement | Severe | 5 years |

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How often does my credit score update?
Lenders report monthly. Scores update when new information is added.

### Why do I have different scores with different bureaus?
Bureaus have different data and scoring models. It's normal for scores to vary.

### Can I get a loan with a 500 credit score?
Yes, through specialist lenders. Rates will be higher, but options exist.

### How long does bad credit last?
Most negative information stays for 5 years. Bankruptcies can last 5-7 years.

### Does getting rejected hurt my score?
The application (inquiry) affects your score, not the rejection. But multiple rejections mean multiple inquiries.

### Should I pay a credit repair company?
Be cautious. Legitimate errors can be disputed for free. Paid services can't remove accurate negative information.
