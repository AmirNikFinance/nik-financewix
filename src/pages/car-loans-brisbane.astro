  cityDescription="Brisbane's car-dependent lifestyle, with long commutes from suburbs like Logan, Ipswich, and the Redcliffe Peninsula, makes affordable vehicle finance a priority for many residents. The Queensland capital's used car market has remained competitive, while new vehicle supply continues to stabilise after years of shortage. NIK Finance helps Brisbane drivers find better car finance than what dealerships along Moorooka's Motor Mile or Logan Road typically offer. Our AI technology assesses your employment type, whether you're a PAYG employee, contractor, or self-employed tradesperson, and matches you with lenders offering the best rates. For Brisbane's large trades and construction workforce, we also arrange finance for utes, vans, and light commercial vehicles with potential tax benefits through chattel mortgage structures."
